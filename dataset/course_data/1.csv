ANT455H1:Anthropology of the Middle East::24L:What can Anthropology, as both an academic discipline and a way of knowing, bring to our understanding of the Middle East, a region deeply entangled in global geopolitics? What kinds of questions have social and cultural anthropologists asked when faced with the diversity of a region that stretches from North Africa to West Asia? This course explores the cultural, historical, and political complexity of the region from an ethnographic perspective, while also attending critically to the way “The Middle East” has been constructed in the first place. Rather than attempting an overview of the entire region, it focuses on themes that have compelled anthropological research in the area in recent decades, including but not limited to war, migration, labour, “terrorism”, gender, racialization, and religion. We will draw from key academic texts in conversation with other genres of knowledge production including film, journalism, and literature. No previous familiarity with the region is required.:ANT207H1::NMC241H1,  RLG204H1,  NMC283Y1:ANTC89H3,  ANT484H1 (Topics: Ethnography of the Middle East and North Africa) taken in Winter 2014,  ANT384H1 (Topics: Peoples of the Middle East and North Africa) taken in Winter 2017, Winter 2018.:Social Science:

Ethnography of the intimate realms of affect raises important questions about knowledge production and methodology as well as offering insight into how people come to act upon the world and what the human consequences of such action are. The course will also examine how the intimate is socially produced and harnessed in the service of politics and culture. Topics will include grief and its lack; dreams and activism; love and social change; memory and imperialism; sexuality and care; and violence and hope.:ANT207H1 and any 300-level course in Society, Culture and Language::::Social Science:
ANT463H1:Anthropology of Racial Capitalism and Dispossession::24S:This course considers racial capitalism from an anthropological perspective through ethnographies and films which examine the role race, colonialism and white supremacy play in shaping and enabling contemporary forms of capitalist accumulation by dispossession in everyday life. Considering dispossession broadly, we will explore not only processes that dispossess people of property and land, but also of rights, modes of belonging, health, citizenship and life. We will also look at the ways people are organizing to reclaim what they have been dispossessed of or denied, from anti-eviction movements and abolitionist organizing to struggles for reproductive rights, food sovereignty and climate justice.:ANT204H1/  ANT207H1::ANT342H1/  ANT366H1::Social Science:
ANT464H1:Black Ethnographies::24S:Black populations in the African Diaspora defy simple characterizations.

CIN337H1:Black Cinema::24L/24P:This course explores the cultural, aesthetic, technological, and political category of “Black cinema.” Across the diaspora, Black cinema is an artistic praxis that utilizes techniques like improvisation and collaboration in order to make and remake the cinematic archive. The films and filmmakers in this category intervene in cinematic histories by responding to exclusionary narratives, technologies, and critical discourse by imagining alternative stories, spaces, and temporalities. Thus, these films help articulate both the pervasiveness of anti-blackness in our visual culture and help us understand the difference (film) aesthetics can make (Chun, 2019). Our goal is to 1) develop a critical language to discuss Black cinema (its techniques, its aims, and its political contexts) and 2) articulate research questions, methods, and arguments that consider what is happening inside and outside the frame in these films.:CIN105Y1::::Humanities:

CLA160H1:Introduction to Classical Studies::36L/10T:An introduction to major themes in the development of Greek and Roman civilization, literature and culture.:::::Humanities:
CLA195H1:Herakles::24S:At the centre of this course stands one of the most famous ancient heroes, Herakles. Through a close analysis of literary sources and visual artifacts, we will examine the representation of Herakles in various texts and contexts (as a hero ridding the world of monsters, a tragic figure gone mad, a precocious child, a comic glutton, a transvestite, etc.) as well as the different usages to which this figure was put in Greco-Roman culture. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA196H1:Animals::24S:This course offers a survey of some of ways in which animals enter into the texts produced by Greco-Roman antiquity. The deployment of animals is varied. But most discussions of animals - whether scientific, literary, allegorical or practical - tend to shed a great deal of light on the question of what the people who produced these accounts thought it meant to be human. Animals are simultaneously our doubles, neighbors, slaves, and tools. And even as strangers, they speak to our sense of self. We will also consider this ancient material in light of the way we talk about animals today. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA197H1:Craft and Wisdom::24S:Technê [craft, art, or expertise] is a powerful concept in ancient Greek thought. To have a craft is to have a kind of wisdom; but we may need further wisdom to use craft well. This course explores the significance of technê and its complex relation to sophia, wisdom, in early Greek thought. Topics include the divine wisdom (and craft) of the poet, the mysterious Seven Sages, the mythic origins of the crafts, craft and the city, debates about bogus and borderline cases, and the sophistic and Socratic idea of an 'art of politics'. Readings will include Hesiod’s Works and Days, sophistic fragments, medical texts, and several brief Platonic dialogues. Comparisons may also be explored to contemporary theories of skill and technology, and similar ideas in ancient Chinese philosophy. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA198H1:Homer's Odyssey down through Time::24S:This course will survey creative works inspired by Homer's Odyssey. First we will read through the Odyssey, contextualizing the Homeric epic within the larger story of the Trojan War and the subsequent heroic return in the "Epic Cycle." Then we will study various "receptions" of the Odyssey, ancient and modern. Ancient works will include the satyr play Cyclops by Euripides and portrayals of a love-sick Cyclops in Theocritus and Ovid. In True Story Lucian calls Odysseus a liar but rivals his travel tale with episodes placed on the moon and inside a whale. Modern works include Atwood's Penelopiad, Walcott's stage version of the Odyssey, and the film "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" Themes will include travel literature, truth and lying, localization of the wanderings of Odysseus, culture clash, and the definition of home. All this material, various in date, media, and fidelity to their Homeric source, will provide us with a well-rounded sense of how the Odyssey has been re-imagined over the ages. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA199H1:The “Decline and Fall” of the Roman Empire::24S:After a high water mark of territorial reach and economic success in the middle of the 2nd century CE, the Roman Empire eventually disintegrated. How? Why? When? In this course, we will consider some of the historical features that may have contributed to its political collapse, and we will consider some modern scholarly analyses from Edward Gibbon (late 18th century) to the present. But we will also investigate “decline and fall” as a narrative trope. Why is this story arc always with us? Who decides what qualifies as “decline”? Is the “fall” of some systems necessarily a bad thing? Among the topics to be considered in the context of the Later Roman Empire are several of relevance in the modern world, not least: climate change, disease, human migration, religious difference, and economic inequality. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:

CSC197H1:What, Who, How: Privacy in the Age of Big Data Collection::24S:The rapid advance of technology has brought remarkable changes to how we conduct our daily lives, from how we communicate, consume news and data, and purchase goods. As we increase our online activity, so too do we increase the amount of personal data that we're sharing, often without realizing it. The questions of exactly what data is being collected, who is collecting and accessing this data, and how this data is being used, have significant implications for both individuals and our larger social and political institutions. Organized by a wide variety of case studies drawn from current events, we'll study how personal data can be collected and tracked, how personal and social factors may influence our own decisions about whether and how much to share our data, and what broader political and legal tools are used to either protect or subvert individual privacy. Restricted to first-year students.

DTS199H1:Superman and Other Migrants::24S:From the 1938 debut of Superman until the spate of recent autobiographical graphic novels by immigrants and children of immigrants, the development of the comic and graphic novel form has been intricately bound up with the diaspora experience. In this course, we will explore the emergence of the superhero from the immigrant experience; trace the depiction of migrants, immigrants and refugees in recent graphic novels; and study visual strategies for representing migration and displacement.

DTS200Y1:Introduction to Diaspora and Transnational Studies I::48L:What is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.::::DTS201H1,  DTS202H1:Humanities, Social Science:

DTS310H1:Transnational Toronto::24L:Toronto is a city increasingly configured through transnational connections and practices. It is a city defined by the scale at which its residents live their lives; a scale that is no longer (if it ever was) parochial, but extends across time and space to connect people and practice across a multitude of locales. Contemporary understandings of Toronto can only be reached through adopting a transnational lens. This course will examine the processes that have produced Toronto as a transnational city over time, including the dynamics of immigration and mobility, experiences of alienation, the global extension of capitalism, and the (re)formation of communities grounded in the complex dynamics of identities produced in a space that is both ‘home’ and away’. We will also explore the specific practices, and connections that produce “Toronto” as a space that transcends its physical geographic boundaries and is continually reproduced in and through the flows of people, capital, objects, ideas, - and the many forces that reproduce and reconfigure these flows.:Completion of 9.0 credits::DTS200Y1::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS311H1:Fun in Diaspora::24L:From parkour to “Baby Shark” remixes, concepts and practices surrounding fun, entertainment, and pleasure transcend cultural boundaries, reveal the reach of globalization, and help facilitate the maintenance of transnational communities through shared activities. This course will examine these relationships with fun, and we will also assess cases where concepts of fun diverge and clash in intercultural contexts. Additionally, the class will consider the relationship between entertainment practices and politics, marketing, and social movements. Cases examined will include K-pop fandom, bucket challenges, social media memes, and global YouTube phenomena.:DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS312H1:Exile::24S:Historically used to describe both voluntary departure and enforced banishment from a city, today, "Exile" is perhaps most famously associated with both the Jewish and the Palestinian condition. But exile is also a state of being, one that is creative, critical, and full of meaning-making. This class posits “Exile” as a conceptual framework through which to think through the 21st-century condition of migration and diaspora. Through foundational texts and historic case studies, particularly drawn from East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, we will consider how exile has been deployed in order to bring together diverse situations under a unifying theory of both individual and collective experience.:DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS314H1:Citizenship and Multiculturalism::24S:This course examines approaches to belonging and distinction that accompany different models of citizenship. What are some historical and recent trends in the intersections of place, custom, and rights? How have governments related social diversity to social justice in theory and in practice? Areas of emphasis will vary, but may include topics such as authenticity and assimilation; ethno-nationalism; immigration and naturalization policy; indigeneity; insurgency; legacies of colonialism; mass media and popular culture; policing and surveillance; racial stratification; transnational markets; and xenophobia.:DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:

DTS410H1:Diasporic Foodways::24S:Food links people across space and time. As it spirals outward from parochial sites of origin to articulate with new sites, actors and scales, it assumes new substance and meaning in new locales. This movement of food gives rise to new ‘foodways’ to help us to understand the past in terms of temporally connected sites of intense interaction. Food also plays a strong role in shaping translocal identities. As peoples have moved in the world, food has played a central role in (re)defining who they are, reproducing myth and ritual, and bounding diasporic communities. This course seeks to address questions surrounding the dynamics of the food ‘we’ eat, the ways in which ‘we’ eat, the meaning ‘we’ give to eating, and the effect of eating in a transnational world. Recognizing that culinary culture is central to diasporic identifications, the focus is on the place of food in the enduring habits, rituals, and everyday practices that are collectively used to produce and sustain a shared sense of diasporic cultural identity.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS411H1:Transnational Justice::24S:This course explores the intersection between local conceptions of justice and their transnational and institutional circulations. It interrogates competing meanings of justice and examines the varied practices of actors engaged in justice making domains. From international human rights, to transitional justice and truth and reconciliation, to international legal and traditional justice formulations, the course offers students an opportunity to learn about and critically reflect on the processes and purposes through which justice conceptions are structured, implemented and being contested in the contemporary period. Topics include: theories of transnationalism, transnational justice, social injustice, law and culture, universalism, racism and social inequality.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS412H1:The Diasporic Imagination::24S:This course focuses on echoes of diasporic and transnational life in artistic work, and on the significance of aesthetic production to the formation of diasporic and transnational worlds. How have practices, producers, and works of art illuminated the particularities of diasporic life? How do conventions of genre, performance, and tradition shape experiences of borders and crossings? Areas of emphasis will vary but may spotlight particular historical and geographic contexts, and may foreground one or more form, including film, poetry, fiction, music, and dance.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS413H1:Global Sexualities::24S:Sexuality is a complex interplay of desires, attractions, interests, and modes of behavior and has diverse meanings in different societies and cultures. In this course, we will examine the notion of sexuality as well as gender identity and expression from an interdisciplinary perspective that is rooted in ethnography. A cross-cultural study of sexuality and gender identity within global and transnational contexts will provide students with an understanding of how the intersections of culture, community, as well as social and political factors affect individuals’ sexual choices and understandings of gender. A particular focus in this course will be experiences of sexuality and gender within diasporic communities.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1/ SDS380H1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS414H1:Money on the Move::24S:In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, industry and finance matured together, pushing people into motion around the world. The instruments of long-distance trade, like insurance, credit and debt, connected cities and continents in new and sometimes unsettling ways. The free movement of goods and cash was mirrored by restrictions on migration to some parts of the world and by forced or coerced migration to others. This course explores the history of the rise of global capitalism at a human scale, exploring how financialization, industrialization and imperialism overlapped and intertwined, and how the remaking of the world in the image of capital weighed on human lives.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS415H1:Diaspora at Home::24S:What is the relationship between diaspora and domesticity? What does it mean to inhabit the position of the stranger not in the public life of the city, but in the private sphere of the household? This course approaches questions of migration, labour, and foreignness through the prism of the home. We consider the international phenomenon of migrant domestic labour and how it shapes social and family relations, both in countries of origin such as the Philippines and Ethiopia, as well as in countries of employment such as Canada and Lebanon. But we also reflect on how migration radically transforms life inside the home, affecting what it means to be a parent, a child, or a partner. In doing so we draw upon diverse representations of “the family”, kinship, and intimacy across both the humanities and the social sciences.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS416H1:Wars, Diaspora and Music::24S:The course explores how composers, performers, songwriters and audiences made sense of traumatic and violent events that they experienced, such as ethnic conflicts, wars, exile and displacement, through music. We will also look at how government ideologies employ music during wars. The case studies will include stories of Jewish, Palestinian, Afghan, Romani, Korean, Rwandan and other diasporas severely affected by wars and violence.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS417H1:9 to 5: A Transnational History of the Working Day::24S:Work is a central preoccupation in human life and culture, and the working day – measured in daylight, in shifts, or in tasks and ‘gigs’ – is, for most people, the basic unit of work. A ‘day’s work’ is so ubiquitous that it seems natural – but it is not – the offices, worksites, hourly wages and everyday forms of discipline and surveillance that shape working lives have a history. This course explores the transnational and diasporic histories of working life, from plantations to factories to offices to informal work at the margins of global industrial capitalism.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:

EAS193H1:What is “The Yellow Peril”?::24L:This course explores the old and new reincarnations of “the Yellow Peril” complex. The 2020 naming of COVID-19 as “the Chinese virus” by the U.S. president Donald Trump has provoked much anger, criticism, and concerns for anti-Asian violence and the reagitation of “The Yellow Peril” panic. Yet the imaginaries of “the Yellow Peril” and their power effects have been engrained in our political modernity, the Enlightenment ideas, and its institutions in a much more complex, far-reaching, and intersecting ways in East Asia and beyond. The course will explore various types of cultural productions, including history, literature, film, news media, etc., to introduce the racial, colonial, capitalist, sexual, militarized, and other dimensions of the “Yellow Peril.” Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:

ECO197H1:Seminar on Classical Economic Thought::24L/12T:This seminar examines the basic ideas of the five most notable economic thinkers before 1870: Aristotle, Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx. We focus on demand as the basis of price in Aristotle; the ambiguity in Smith between a labour theory of value and a demand/supply theory of value; the principle of population in Malthus; Ricardo’s labour theory of value and his theory of rent and economic growth; and Marx’s labour theory of value as the explanation for the development of capital. The understanding in these authors of economics as an historical process of production gives fascinating insights into modern economic development that contrast with the modern economic concentration on the distribution of resources in a world of scarcity. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
ECO198H1:Seminar on Modern Economic Thought::24L/12T:This seminar examines the development of modern economic thought from the marginal revolutionaries (Jevons and Menger) who proclaimed that demand in the form of utility was the basis of price to the supply/demand analysis of Alfred Marshall that established modern microeconomics by 1890. We then look at Irving Fisher’s 1907 foundation of the modern concept of the interest rate and the present value of capital before reviewing J.M. Keynes’ 1936 criticism of neo-classical positions on full employment and interest rates in arguing for government manipulation of interest rates to ensure full employment. We finish with Milton Friedman’s championing of the unregulated market economy through his quantity theory of money critique of Keynes. Restricted to first-year students.

ECO199H1:Economics and Sustainable, Green Development::24L/12T:Economic growth has been a powerful force through history in improving living standards throughout the world. At the same time, there is a growing recognition that environmental damages frequently accompany this growth, whether it be at the local level (soil degradation and deforestation), or the global level (climate change). Economics studies the allocation of scarce resources, but how can it incorporate "the environment" in a meaningful way that can help guide policy-makers in the 21st century? This course is a fast review of economic approaches and tools, and a review of a wide range of environmental policies, designed to manage the possible adverse impacts of economic expansions. The major emphasis in this course is on the market-based policies that guarantee incentive compatibility of these policies, thus, a higher chance of success. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:

ENV461H1:The U of T Campus as a Living Lab of Sustainability::24L:Sustainability is a growing priority for universities all over the world. Many are developing strong operational sustainability goals and targets, and are giving increasing emphasis to teaching and research on sustainability issues. Yet few have committed at the executive level to integrating academic and operational sustainability in the context of treating their campus as a living laboratory of sustainable practice, research and teaching. Arguably, it is such living lab approaches that offer the largest potential for universities to play a significant role in the sustainability transition. This course will explore and apply the living lab concept, in the context of operational sustainability at the University of Toronto. We will begin by looking at the literature on university sustainability and the living lab concept. The bulk of the course will involve undertaking an applied research project on some aspect of campus sustainability, working in close partnership with operational staff at the University of Toronto. Students will develop the skills needed to work across disciplines and fields of study, and with non-academic partners. This course will put students to work on operational sustainability projects identified by the staff working in or with the Sustainability Office at the University of Toronto. Students will be organized into groups, each of which will be assigned one project, to be overseen by one or more U of T staff members. The bulk of the course will consist of regular meetings with the staff “clients”, with instructors, and in small groups to undertake a group project. Each group will produce a mid-term and final report, and give a mid-term and final presentation. Each student will also submit two 360 reviews of the group process. A crucial aspect of this course is the ability of students to work collaboratively together in a group environment, and to work effectively with a university staff person acting as a “client” for their work. Students will be provided with a Handbook outlining information on working in groups and the focus of the class in the second week will be on this issue. The first 360 peer review will serve to provide information on how well each group is working. Students are encouraged to discuss and resolve group process issues in the weekly group meetings, and in their regular meetings with the instructor and TA. The second 360 review will occur at the end of the term. The results of the two 360 reviews will be used, where appropriate, to adjust individual marks from the group averages.:Completion of 10.0 credits including  ENV221H1 or  ENV222H1; or permission of the Undergraduate Associate Director::1.0 credit of environment-related coursework::Social Science, Science, Humanities:

FAH304H1:Architecture of Ancient Greece::24L:In this course we will survey the history of Greek architecture and its impact on the buildings of the ancient Mediterranean. Chronologically, we will begin in the latter second millennium BCE, examining the consequences of the collapse of Mycenaean society on Greek building, after which we will examine the synthesis and dissemination of exciting new forms of monumental building at Greek sanctuaries and cities during the Archaic and Classical periods (ca. 700–350/323 BCE). We will conclude with the developments of the Hellenistic period, the era of eastern Mediterranean empires when architectural patronage is increasingly dominated by Greek and Hellenized royalty. Along the way, the course will examine topics such as the interpretation of meaning in Greek buildings and their sculptural decoration, the origins of building technologies, the interaction of Greek and non-Greek architects and builders, and the reception of Greek architectural forms within non-Greek contexts throughout the Mediterranean.:1.0 FAH credit at any level/  CLA210H1/  CLA220H5::FAH205H5/  FAH206H1/  FAH207H1/  FAH208H1:FAH380H1 (offered as "Greek Architecture") taken in Winter 2020 and 2022:Humanities:
FAH307H1:Ancient Art, Migration, and the Barbarian ‘Other’::24L:This course surveys the cultural, artistic and social interactions between the Graeco-Roman world and the so-called ‘Barbarians’ beyond its eastern and northern confines.

CE). The course will address issues of artistic production, material culture, ritual and cult in relation to the mobility of peoples and groups, objects and individuals.:1.0 FAH credit::FAH205H5/  FAH207H1::Humanities:

FAH311H1:Greek Sculpture::24L:The course provides a thorough examination of ancient Greek sculpture from 7th - 1st century BCE, which in many ways defined the canon of western art that was to follow. Classic issues of style, dating, and technique are complemented by putting them into the contexts of cultural history, religion and socio-politics. While the course is a traditional monument-based survey of major sculptural works from the ancient Greek world, several important issues are also addressed, pertaining both to contemporary society and the study of other areas of art history. These include but are not limited to: gender, social class, colonialism, notion of the artist, originality, and aesthetic theory.:1.0 FAH credit::FAH205H5/  FAH207H1/  FAH208H1::Humanities:

FAH314H1:Eroticism in Ancient Art::24L:Erotic ‘imagery’ – sculptures, reliefs, paintings – is ubiquitous in ancient art, to a degree that modern viewers have often found disturbing. This course faces the challenge posed by the ancient predilection for such imagery and explores it from a critical and scholarly perspective. At its most basic level, it reassigns a seemingly universal segment of human ‘nature’ and experience to the realm of culture, by examining the imagery against the background of ancient constructions of sexuality, gender and the body. But it also explores the libidinal and hedonic structure of the works of art themselves and asks for the functions of erotic imagery in its respective contexts. The course will avail itself of the excellent research on gender, sexuality and eroticism in antiquity that has been produced over the past few decades, and it will also explore the topic’s lateral connections with the thematic fields of ancient humour, the ‘grotesque’, apotropaism, myth and magic.:1.0 FAH credit::FAH205H5/  FAH207H1::Humanities:

FAH325H1:Urban Islam::24L:By challenging essentialist questioning of Islamic urbanism, this course considers the inter-animated and complex web of forces that drive cities forward by identifying repertoires of underlying logic. Through a deep and historically situated reading of Medieval Mecca, Medina, Damascus, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordoba, we will map and encode history on the urban scale to reveal what makes a city "Islamic." Visual mapping skill cultivation for communication purposes (both digital and analogue) will be taught throughout to enhance understandings of urban complexity in rich historical contexts.:1.0 FAH credit::FAH265H1/ FAH326H1::Humanities:
FAH326H1:Cultural History of Islamic Spain::24L:From its earliest beginnings as an Umayyad province and up until the 15th century, al-Andalus acted as a lynch pin within the Mediterranean world. Connecting the Islamic empire in the East and forging links of trade and cultural exchange with Europe to the West, cities such as Cordoba and Granada captured the imagination of contemporary chroniclers, earning descriptions in the sources as truly “first-rate places”. Through an exploration of the historical, artistic, architectural, urban, social and economic contexts, this course will engage with and expand upon current understandings of this seminal period in Islamic history to examine Islam’s encounters and modes of cultural exchange with Europe and the Mediterranean world.:1.0 FAH credit::::Humanities:

FAH331H1:Netherlandish Renaissance Art and Culture::24L:The Netherlands had become one of Europe’s most fertile artistic cultures by the sixteenth century. Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel are famous today for their paintings of Hell and peasant life. Other painters introduced mythological and erotic subject matter, while practitioners in the other arts were perhaps even more widely known. Netherlandish sculptors created the tombs of northern European rulers, defining their public identity in the communal space of church and chapel. Miniature carved altarpieces helped guide modes of private devotion and were widely imitated from Italy to Scandinavia. Netherlandish tapestries broadcast the heroic deeds of the Caesars and the patriarchs in the palaces of kings and high nobles as prototypes for their reigns. We will examine the rise of the Renaissance manner in northern Europe, the role of the religious arts, the ideology of urban culture, the consequences of the Reformation and iconoclasm, the functions of various species of portraiture, and the particular properties of different media, while dedicating much attention to Bosch and Bruegel. And we will concentrate on the sixteenth century, the era in which the Netherlands was closely linked to the rest of Europe, from Italy to Sweden, from England to Ukraine.:1.0 FAH credit::FAH230H1/  FAH274H5/  VPHB74H3::Humanities:

FAH402H1:Palaces of Minoan Crete::24L:Around 2000 BC, the island of Crete sees the emergence of what are arguably the earliest towns and states in European prehistory. At the heart of this new social order are the so-called ‘palaces’, massive architectural complexes usually interpreted as seats of administrative and political authority. However, fresh discoveries over the past two decades, coupled recently with radical new interpretations, require a fundamental rethinking of the nature of the palaces and their role in Minoan society. This course will provide students with an active opportunity to learn about the latest developments in Minoan art, architecture, and archaeology.:FAH206H1 and 1.0 FAH credit at the 300 level::FAH303H1:FAH423H1:Humanities:

A substantial part of the course deals with his representations in Greek art, and the god's relationship to the Greeks as the governing figure of many important facets of their lives: drinking practices, sexuality, the performative arts, and the transition into the afterlife through the notion of eternal bliss. The course reading draws on art historical literature, as well as primary sources, and theoretical texts regarding religion and cultural practices.:FAH307H1/  FAH310H1/  FAH311H1/  FAH312H1/  FAH313H1/  FAH314H1, and an additional 0.5 FAH credit at the 300-level::::Humanities:
FAH406H1:Cross-Cultural Issues in Ancient Art Beyond Greece and Rome::24S:When cultures collide, they assimilate, they exchange, they transform, and they develop, and there seems to be a pattern of recognizable centres of power around which artistic tradition often revolves. This has caused the conventional understanding of certain flowering of artistic heritage as a product of cross-cultural influences. This course is a seminar style survey that explores these fascinating amalgams of artistic traditions that lie at the Eastern outskirts of the Hellenistic world throughout the roman Period, from Bactria to India, and with a heavy focus on the Buddhist art of Gandhara, reaching out along the Silk Road. As the title suggests, the class aims at a renewed framework that re-evaluates the role of the Ancient West, which has been absent since the heavily Eurocentric scholarship from the early 20th century. It also aims to familiarize students with current theoretical issues surrounding cross-cultural studies as it pertains to the visual arts, touching upon modern postcolonial theories of space.:FAH307H1/  FAH310H1/  FAH311H1/  FAH312H1/  FAH313H1/  FAH314H1, and an additional 0.5 FAH credit at the 300-level::FAH311H1::Humanities:

FAH415H1:History of Islamic Cairo::24S:This seminar explores the architectural and urban development of Islamic Cairo (al-Qahira) between the 7th and 16th centuries. As a nexus of both the Islamic empire and the Mediterranean world, Cairo provides an opportunity to explore a major Islamic Medieval city. Modern day Cairo emerged first as a provincial capital (al-Fustat and later al-Qata'a) in the 7th and 8th century and later morphed into a capital under successive dynasties from the 9th to the 16th century. Exploring Cairo throughout this critical historical period, one of both relative stability and upheaval during the post-conquest period to the Crusades, allows for a better understanding of the reciprocity between architecture and urbanism on the one hand and broader political shifts on the other. A central organizing theme of this course is Cairo's position as a place of multiplicity and confessional diversity, embedded within networks of cultural and economic exchange. Other themes explored include the role played by ceremonies and processions on urban form and the development of public space as well as the development of various religious, charitable, military and educational institutions and their impact upon shaping the city.:1.0 FAH credit at the 300 level::FAH265H1/ FAH326H1::Humanities:

FAH490H1:Introduction to the Textile Arts of the Indian Ocean World::24S:The Indian Ocean has been called the Cradle of Globalization. For thousands of years monsoon winds linked the people and arts of this vast Ocean that stretches from East Africa in the West to Indonesia (and beyond) in the East. Throughout its long history, handwoven textiles have been amongst the area’s greatest art forms, trade goods, religious objects and markers of identity. This course will survey the wide variety of these forms, from c. 1100 to 1950. Special attention is placed on India, which lies at the center of the region, and originated many of the fibres, techniques, design and iconography of the wider area. Select regional manifestations are then examined in depth, using the ROM’s extensive collections. These range from the silks of Madagascar, to embroidered men’s wear of Oman, to the cosmopolitan batiks of northern coastal Java. It is seen that all these traditions can best be understood within the framework of the wider Indian Ocean region.:1.0 FAH credit at the 300-level::Asian art, Islamic art, or anthropology::Humanities:

FCS196H1:Historical, Geographic and Social Variation in French::24S:Throughout most of its nearly 1200-year history, the language that we now call French was not a single linguistic entity, but rather a collection of related dialects. Although socio-political factors resulted in a partial unification of these dialects during the 18th and 19th centuries, the unification was, to a large extent, outweighed by French colonization of areas such as North America and Africa, which resulted in even greater linguistic diversification. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the extensive variation that exists throughout the French-speaking world. Topics to be covered include phonetics (pronunciation), lexicology (word selection) and morpho-syntax (grammar). This course is taught in English. No knowledge of French or linguistics is required. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
