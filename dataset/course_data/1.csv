ANT450H1:Multispecies Cities::24S:As of 2007, for the first time in human history, more than half the world’s peoples lived in cities. It is estimated that by 2030 over 60% will be urban-dwellers. This demographic shift suggests that for many (if not most) people, their primary encounter with “nature” will be urban based. This course explores the idea of “urban-nature” by 1) focusing on the ways in which various theorists have challenged traditional ways of viewing both “the city” and “nature” and 2) encouraging students to develop their own critical perspectives through ethnographic engagements with the city of Toronto.:ANT204H1 or  ANT207H1 and a 300-level course or above in Society, Culture and Language::::Social Science:
ANT455H1:Anthropology of the Middle East::24L:What can Anthropology, as both an academic discipline and a way of knowing, bring to our understanding of the Middle East, a region deeply entangled in global geopolitics? What kinds of questions have social and cultural anthropologists asked when faced with the diversity of a region that stretches from North Africa to West Asia? This course explores the cultural, historical, and political complexity of the region from an ethnographic perspective, while also attending critically to the way “The Middle East” has been constructed in the first place. Rather than attempting an overview of the entire region, it focuses on themes that have compelled anthropological research in the area in recent decades, including but not limited to war, migration, labour, “terrorism”, gender, racialization, and religion. We will draw from key academic texts in conversation with other genres of knowledge production including film, journalism, and literature. No previous familiarity with the region is required.:ANT207H1::NMC241H1,  RLG204H1,  NMC283Y1:ANTC89H3,  ANT484H1 (Topics: Ethnography of the Middle East and North Africa) taken in Winter 2014,  ANT384H1 (Topics: Peoples of the Middle East and North Africa) taken in Winter 2017, Winter 2018.:Social Science:

Tracing, then, the transnational turn in the anthropology of sexuality, the course engages important debates about culture, locality, and globalization. By focusing on the transnational movement of desires, practices, and pleasures through activisms, mass media, and tourism, the course asks how sex is global and how globalization is thoroughly sexed. Course material will stress, but not be limited to, forms of same-sex or otherwise queer sexualities.:ANT207H1 and any 300-level course in Society, Culture and Language::::Social Science:

ANT462H1:Anthropology of Affect::24S:This course examines how anthropologists have studied the way that people hope, imagine, love, and despise. Ethnography of the intimate realms of affect raises important questions about knowledge production and methodology as well as offering insight into how people come to act upon the world and what the human consequences of such action are. The course will also examine how the intimate is socially produced and harnessed in the service of politics and culture. Topics will include grief and its lack; dreams and activism; love and social change; memory and imperialism; sexuality and care; and violence and hope.:ANT207H1 and any 300-level course in Society, Culture and Language::::Social Science:
ANT463H1:Anthropology of Racial Capitalism and Dispossession::24S:This course considers racial capitalism from an anthropological perspective through ethnographies and films which examine the role race, colonialism and white supremacy play in shaping and enabling contemporary forms of capitalist accumulation by dispossession in everyday life. Considering dispossession broadly, we will explore not only processes that dispossess people of property and land, but also of rights, modes of belonging, health, citizenship and life. We will also look at the ways people are organizing to reclaim what they have been dispossessed of or denied, from anti-eviction movements and abolitionist organizing to struggles for reproductive rights, food sovereignty and climate justice.:ANT204H1/  ANT207H1::ANT342H1/  ANT366H1::Social Science:
ANT464H1:Black Ethnographies::24S:Black populations in the African Diaspora defy simple characterizations.

CIN196H1:Story Worlds and the Cinema::24S:Films create story worlds, imaginary environments in which characters live and act, and where events, large and small, transpire. Some story worlds are elaborate, fanciful constructs (think of Disney’s animated films). Others stay close to reality (think of “docudramas”). But across the spectrum, all of them are framed by and provided with rules of time and space, of believable or impossible. This course offers an examination of selected story worlds from several periods of film history.

Course includes study of Asian, European, and South American Fantasy films.:::::Humanities:
CIN216H1:Crime Film Traditions::12L/12T/36P:Originating in the mid-19th century from journalistic accounts and detective stories, crime fiction has emerged as one of the dominant popular genres in the 20th century across a variety of media and platforms, from true crime dime novels to radio dramas, from hard-boiled literature to prestige television series. Rejuvenated in the 21st century by the consolidation of gaming culture and the rise of podcasting, crime narratives have expanded to transmediality, stretching the boundaries between fiction and documentary practices. In this context, the culturally porous and generically elastic crime film had remained one of the most enduring cinematic expressions of sociopolitical anxieties related to class, gender, race, and ethnicity.

CIN335H1:Animation after 1950::24L/36P:This course examines the second fifty years of animation, first by marking Disney's shifting fortunes, then broadening the scope to take in its competitors here and abroad. The global nature of postwar animation has been an odd amalgam of competition and cooperation, of private and public funding, and of film, television, and eventually webcasting, and we will explore some of the changes the form has gone through in the past fifty years or so. Since this is a study of art and of commerce, and of high and low culture, we will view our limited history through the lenses of aesthetics, cultural practices, business decisions, and sometimes political struggle.:CIN105Y1,  CIN201Y1::::Humanities:

CIN337H1:Black Cinema::24L/24P:This course explores the cultural, aesthetic, technological, and political category of “Black cinema.” Across the diaspora, Black cinema is an artistic praxis that utilizes techniques like improvisation and collaboration in order to make and remake the cinematic archive. The films and filmmakers in this category intervene in cinematic histories by responding to exclusionary narratives, technologies, and critical discourse by imagining alternative stories, spaces, and temporalities. Thus, these films help articulate both the pervasiveness of anti-blackness in our visual culture and help us understand the difference (film) aesthetics can make (Chun, 2019). Our goal is to 1) develop a critical language to discuss Black cinema (its techniques, its aims, and its political contexts) and 2) articulate research questions, methods, and arguments that consider what is happening inside and outside the frame in these films.:CIN105Y1::::Humanities:
