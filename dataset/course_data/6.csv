MAT436H1:Introduction to Linear Operators::36L:The course will survey the branch of mathematics developed (in its abstract form) primarily in the twentieth century and referred to variously as functional analysis, linear operators in Hilbert space, and operator algebras, among other names (for instance, more recently, to reflect the rapidly increasing scope of the subject, the phrase non-commutative geometry has been introduced). The intention will be to discuss a number of the topics in Pedersen's textbook Analysis Now. Students will be encouraged to lecture on some of the material, and also to work through some of the exercises in the textbook (or in the suggested reference books).

MAT437H1:K-Theory and C* Algebras::36L:The theory of operator algebras was begun by John von Neumann eighty years ago. In one of the most important innovations of this theory, von Neumann and Murray introduced a notion of equivalence of projections in a self-adjoint algebra (*-algebra) of Hilbert space operators that was compatible with addition of orthogonal projections (also in matrix algebras over the algebra), and so gave rise to an abelian semigroup, now referred to as the Murray-von Neumann semigroup. Later, Grothendieck in geometry, Atiyah and Hirzebruch in topology, and Serre in the setting of arbitrary rings (pertinent for instance for number theory), considered similar constructions. The enveloping group of the semigroup considered in each of these settings is now referred to as the K-group (Grothendieck's terminology), or as the Grothendieck group. Among the many indications of the depth of this construction was the discovery of Atiyah and Hirzebruch that Bott periodicity could be expressed in a simple way using the K-group. Also, Atiyah and Singer famously showed that K-theory was important in connection with the Fredholm index. Partly because of these developments, K-theory very soon became important again in the theory of operator algebras. (And in turn, operator algebras became increasingly important in other branches of mathematics.) The purpose of this course is to give a general, elementary, introduction to the ideas of K-theory in the operator algebra context. (Very briefly, K-theory generalizes the notion of dimension of a vector space.) The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications.

MST231H1:On the Move in Mediaeval Eurasia::24L:In this age of constant global travel, it is easy both to forget how much more complicated travel was in earlier periods, and to assume that there was very little of it. In the Mediaeval world, people travelled for work as traders, craftsmen and warriors; they travelled for their spirit as pilgrims; they travelled as migrants and refugees. This course will introduce students to the variety of people on the move in Mediaeval Eurasia, their motives, and the means they used to travel.:::::Humanities:
MST232H1:How to Be a Barbarian: Beard, Battles and Belief at the Dawn of the Middle Ages::24L:Barbarians have caught the modern popular imagination, and they appear to be much the same: hairy warriors who destroyed civilization. The late antique period (c.300âc.600) was a time of transition and the meetings of several cultures. This course examines the so-called barbarians who entered and soon came to rule the former Roman provinces of western Europe in this period. Our particular focus is the cultural, religious, artistic, and socio-economic aspects of barbarian peoples, and how these intersected with the civilization of Rome.:::::Humanities:

Our analysis will draw on literary texts and their various interdisciplinary interpretations and applications.:::::Humanities:
MST300H1:Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages::24L/12T:Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE), king of Macedon, was one of the most successful military campaigners the world has ever seen. By the time he was thirty, he had established a vast empire stretching from Greece in the west to India in the east. Fantastic stories and legends about Alexander the Great circulated throughout the medieval world, from Iceland to Iran and from Ethiopia to England. In this course, we explore what different representations of the same figure can tell us about the range of medieval cultures. Through the use of digital tools, students and the instructor work together to explore this rich material. We trace the transmission of Alexanderâs legend using digital maps. We compare different versions of the same story using text analysis tools. And we curate a small selection of the lavishly-illustrated manuscripts of the Alexander Romance in a digital exhibition.:MST201H1, or  MST202H1, or Permission of Instructor::::Humanities:

MST341H1:Middle Ages by the Numbers::24L:Numbers and their uses often appear to be absolute fact: a thousand dollars is exactly that, not more or less; and if you weigh fifty kilos, thatâs what you weigh. But the use and meaning of numbersâfor recording and counting dates, money, weights, distances, and myriad other functionsâis not, in fact, devoid of cultural, historical, and political context. Mediaeval Europe provided a bewildering range of calendric systems, currencies, systems of measurement, and numerical symbolism was much used in art, music, religious thought, and literature. This course provides an introduction to the various uses of numbers in this period across different regions and cultural contexts.:Completion of 9.0 credits::MST210H1,  MST212H1::Humanities:

MUN101H1:Global Innovation I: Issues and Perspectives::24L:Innovation has always been a key driver of economic growth, population health, and societal success. Transformative change has historically been linked to major innovations such as urban sanitation, pasteurization, the printing press and the industrial revolution. Currently, the opportunity to enhance life chances worldwide relies on innovating for the poor, social innovation, and the ability to harness scientific and technological knowledge. What precisely is innovation? When does innovation happen? Who benefits from innovation? How can innovation be fostered, and how do innovations spread? Relying on major global transformations and country-specific case studies (for example, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel and India), this course examines the drivers of innovation, the political, social, economic, and scientific and technological factors that are critical to promoting innovation and addressing current global challenges, and the consequences of innovation. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:Admission to Munk One::::Social Science:
MUN102H1:Global Innovation II: Challenges and Solutions::24L:Governing public goods has been an age-old concern for social scientists and policymakers alike. This is not surprising since the provision of global public goods is riddled by problems of collective action. In this course, we focus on how to implement solutions through states, markets and communities. The first objective is to familiarize students with the concept of global public goods, the different mechanisms that can provide these goods and the challenges that emerge from lacking incentives to secure their provision. To this end, the course will introduce theories from sociology, political science, philosophy, and history to help us understand different types of governance mechanisms and how they may be used to scale global solutions. Theories can help us explain the tensions between cooperating for the public good at the expense of sacrificing individual goals, or why certain areas of our lives, like the Internet, seem to produce public goods without any formal mechanism of cooperation. The second objective is to use the class and subject of study as an arena to model and practice the kind of learning that is expected of university students. The main skills that the course will help students target and develop are: research (finding, evaluating and assimilating reliable information); writing (developing ideas into logically written arguments); and critical analysis of arguments presented in the readings and debated in class (this includes identifying the key assumptions that are implicit in different theories as well as inherent in our own positions on various questions related to governance).

This course takes a case study approach to dictatorships in Europe in the 20h and 21st centuries. By looking beyond the frequently studied examples of Germany, Italy and the USSR, the class examines less-studied examples in the Balkans and Central Europe such as Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and Albania in the years between the First and Second World Wars, alongside the continuities between those dictatorships and the communist regimes that followed. In contemporary examples, we examine Belarus and Russia alongside so-called hybrid regimes like Hungary. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
MUN198H1:Digital Technologies and Human Rights::24L:What are digital technologies, exactly? How do we govern them? Do they threaten or protect human rights?

NMC101H1:Land of the Pharaohs::24L/12T:Egypt is one of the oldest known civilizations on the African continent. Deeply embedded within early African history, Egypt was also inextricably linked with the history of many civilizations in the Ancient Near East. From pyramids to mummies and from King Tut to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the course will trace the history of ancient Egypt from its foundation around 3050 BCE to its incorporation into the Roman Empire in the 1st Century BCE. The focus will be on various aspects of Egyptian culture, including the institution of kingship, the role of women, and the characteristic features of Egyptian art, literature, and religion. Emphasis will be placed on the methods by which knowledge about this ancient civilization can be obtained.:::::Humanities:
NMC102H1:Heartland of Ancient Empires::24L/12T:Mesopotamia and the ancient Near Eastâthe area of modern Iraq and adjacent regionsâwitnessed the rise of the first cities in the fourth millennium BC and the emergence of the worldâs first empires in the first millennium BC. This course traces Mesopotamian history from the beginnings of agriculture through to the earliest cities, following the trajectory of political development from city states, to territorial states, and finally to the great empires of Assyria, Babylonia, and Achaemenid Persia and their aftermath. It studies the peoples and polities of the ancient Near East, including the Sumerians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. It also examines their cultural contributions, from the development of cuneiform writing to their achievements in law, administration, science, art and architecture, religion, and literature.:::::Humanities:
NMC103H1:The Islamic World::24L/12T:A broad introduction to Islam, including the history, culture, and religion of the people and places that came to be influenced by Islam and that constitute a world civilization. What makes something (an empire or state, or a work of art or music) Islamic? When and how did that which we think of today as Islamic come about? How has âthe Islamicâ changed over time? With these questions in mind, this course introduces students to major figures, events, themes, institutions, and intellectual currents in Islamic history, from its beginnings in the 7th century to the modern period. Key topics to be covered include the rise and spread of Islam, the Qurâan and the role of Arabic, political thought, law and society, and literary and artistic expressions. Attention is paid to the geographical and ethno-linguistic scope of the Muslim world, demonstrating the diversity of peoples and traditions that make up Islamic civilizations.:::::Humanities:
NMC104H1:The Biblical World::24L/12T:Examine the history, lands, peoples, religions, literatures and cultures that produced the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Topics to be covered include an overview of the geography and history of Ancient Israel and Judea, the role of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages, the literary genres reflected in biblical and some contemporary non-biblical texts, and the scholarly methods by which the Bible is studied.:::::Humanities:
NMC195H1:Rebels, Misfits, and Outcasts in Modern Arabic Literature::36S:This course examines modern Arabic literary texts that portray marginalized social figures and groups who have been excluded from a protective system of resources and privileges. Students will read novels and short stories by prominent Arab authors who have represented marginal social groups in their fiction, including representations of the urban poor, the peasantry, the delinquent, the prostitute, sexual minorities, women who reject normative roles, and the political rebel. These fictional texts address issues such as political resistance and rebellion, economic precarity, and social exclusion. Students will engage with these texts by critically examining the role of literature in narrating unspoken and suppressed histories. The class will also introduce students to theoretical modes of literary analysis and interpretation. All texts will be read in English translation. Authors include Mohamed Choukri, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alifa Rifaat, Sonallah Ibrahim, and Arwa Salih. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.::::NMC242H1:Humanities:
NMC196H1:Law and Order in the Ancient Near East::24S:Are human beings basically evil or good? What creates order in society? Coercion? Religion? Can societies operate without law? This course explores different systems of authority and control through ancient texts, focusing on the very first ideas of law in human history. We examine actual law codes, court cases on real estate disputes and conspiracy to commit murder and rape, as well as alternative means of regulating communities such as ideology, ritual and magic. While most courses on ancient law approach the topic from the perspective of modern concerns, this course situates the first law in its own historical, social and political context. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC197H1:Myth and History in the Bible::24S:Reading the Bible is easy, but reading it well isnât. Should we read its stories as history? All of it? Or perhaps only part of it? If so, which parts? And if some parts arenât meant to be read as history, then what are they? Was Jonah really swallowed by a large fish? Did the sun and moon stand still for Joshua? Did Moses really part the Red Sea? Did Jesus really raise Lazarus from the dead? Are miracles necessarily fiction? In this seminar, we will read together many of the most colourful stories of the Bible, sometimes alongside similar stories from the cultural context of ancient Israel, and discuss what genre (history, myth, legend, folktale) they belong to and how this affects our reading of these texts. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC198H1:Iranian Women Reveal Their Lives: The First Generation::24S:Persian women born in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century were products of a period of major social and cultural change. For the first time, an educated female could envision a life beyond the conservative ideal of a woman's proper place in the home. We will use memoirs of women who were able to contribute to Iranian society and interviews with women whose ambitions were inhibited or repressed by the dominance of patriarchal culture. Poems by women of this early generation vividly reveal both anger and hopes for the future. Memories of a Persian Childhood helps us to appreciate the important role of the family and childhood experience in the lives and ambitions of the first generation of Persian women to be unveiled and have access to a modern education. Both the Course Readings and Seminar Discussions are crucial to this course for exploring Persian women as individuals who grappled with the challenge of government initiatives and social conservatism. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC199H1:Babylon: Fact vs. Fiction::24S:The ancient city of Babylon, now a vast archaeological site in Iraq about 100km south of Baghdad, has captured peopleâs imagination up to this day. Who has not heard of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Biblical Tower of Babel, or the sci-fi TV series Babylon 5? Yet, how much of that reflects the reality of ancient Babylon? This course will explore the city of Babylon through its texts and archaeology and contrast this data with the way the city has been remembered over the past two thousand years. However, the goal of the course is not only to investigate how myths about Babylon have been constructed throughout the centuries. It will also look at the shortcomings of contemporary academic research on Babylon, and how difficult it is to reconstruct humankind's distant past. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC241H1:Anthropology of the Middle East::24L:This course aims to familiarize students with the anthropological study of the contemporary Middle East. It introduces key questions and concepts for anthropological study: who speaks for the Middle East? What is culture? What is ethnography? It analyzes systems of power and exclusion, and everyday life and relations in countries like Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and Kuwait. The course will provide critical perspectives on gender, religion, family relations, national belonging, migrant workers, and refugees. Students will apply anthropological methods learned in class to do an independent project.:::NMC278H1/ ANT207H1:RLG355H1:Humanities:
NMC243H1:The Arabic Novel::24L:This course focuses on the origins and development of the novel genre in the modern Arabic literary tradition. The course examines the aesthetic qualities of the novel as an artistic form as well as the ways it has represented and intervened in the modern social, political, and cultural upheavals that have shaped the Arabic-speaking world from the mid 19th century to the 21st century. Students will read literary criticism that addresses the Arabic novelâs emergence and consolidation as a major literary form and will engage with contemporary methods of literary analysis and interpretation. Topics addressed in the course include textual representations of colonialism and post-colonialism, gender and sexuality, representations of the peasantry, the nation-state and Arab nationalism, and discourses of progress and modernity. Authors include Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, Yahya Haqqi, Naguib Mahfouz, Tayeb Salih, Latifa al-Zayyat, Mohamad Choukri, and Hanan al-Shaykh. Readings of novels and criticism in English translation.:::::Humanities:
NMC244H1:The Arab Spring and Cultural Production::24L:This course examines the Arab revolutions that began in 2011 and their ongoing repercussions through the lens of cultural production. How have Arab writers and artists contributed to and reflected upon the Arab revolutions known as the Arab Spring? How has cultural production mediated the demands, aspirations, and struggles of the Arab peoples during and after these transformative revolutionary struggles? The cultural texts examined in this course range from those that mediate the euphoric optimism heralded by the revolutions to those that narrate and reflect upon the dystopian aftermath after revolutionary failure, including fiction and art that considers the reassertion of authoritarian rule, the violence of civil war, and the homelessness of exile. Through novels, poetry, music, art, and film, the course will broadly consider the role of culture as an alternative mode of narrating and historicizing the Arab revolutions.:3.0 credits at the 100-level::::Humanities:

NMC246H1:Sumerian and Babylonian Literature in Translation::24L:This course explores some of the worldâs oldest literature, including the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian Epic of Creation. It surveys the major literary genres from ancient Mesopotamia, including epics, myths, lyrical poetry, wisdom literature, and humorous tales. It covers literary compositions written in the Sumerian and Babylonian languages using the cuneiform script, ranging in date from the third millennium BC through to the first millennium BC. The course also examines the scholarly and cultural context in which these works were created and preserved for posterity, including the role of scribal training, the nature of Mesopotamian scholarship, royal sponsorship, and the formation of ancient libraries.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC247H1:The Intellectual History of the Ancient Near East::24L:Survey of the intellectual life in the Ancient Near East from the emergence of writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt at the end of the third millennium BCE until the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

NMC248H1:Ancient Bureaucracies::24L:Where were taxes first collected? When was the first receipt issued? What did the first account ledgers look like? This course offers an introduction to the development of early bureaucracies in ancient Mesopotamia (Iraq), Iran and Syria. Find out how accounting procedures evolved after 6,500 BC, from closing storage containers in Neolithic villages with seals and sealings to complex recording procedures in urban settings that ultimately led to the development of writing on clay tablets around 3,100 BC. Learn how different patterns of irrigation in river-based agricultural societies such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China led to similar yet distinct systems of resource management and administration, using different writing materials (e.g. clay tablets, papyrus) based on available raw materials. And see how bureaucratic procedures, while helping to maximize efficiency in an ancient society, could also create a lack of flexibility, ultimately leading to political decline or collapse.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC251H1:Voices from Ancient Egypt::24L:This course introduces students to the culture of ancient Egypt through the study of âfunctionalâ textual materials. After a brief introduction to the Ancient Egyptian language and writing system, we will read texts from domestic, religious (comprising funerary and ritual), historical, and scientific backgrounds to paint a rich picture of the daily life and experiences of the ancient Egyptians. By way of example, we will illustrate Egyptian funerary beliefs on the basis of texts found in tombs, such as autobiographies, offering formulae, and letters left there for the dead by their families; or the role of the pharaoh for the Egyptian state by studying monumental inscriptions left on temple walls, boundary stelae, and in the tombs of the Egyptian elite. No knowledge of Ancient Egyptian required; all texts read in translation.:::NMC101H1::Humanities:
NMC252H1:Hebrew Bible::24L:An introduction to the critical study of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and the related literature of ancient Jewish communities (Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls). English translations used; no knowledge of Hebrew is required.:::NMC104H1::Humanities:
NMC253H1:Egyptian Myths::24L:This course explores ancient Egyptian mythical writings and representations, starting with the myths contained in the Pyramid Texts of the 3rd millennium BCE and ending with the narrative mythical tales of the 1st millennium BCE and beyond. Definitions and theories of ancient Egyptian myth as well as historical developments will be discussed, and we will attempt to explain why religious beliefs and stories changed. The course is structured systematically, focusing in particular on mythical accounts that elucidate Egyptian cosmic, royal, and funerary beliefs as well as the intersection of these domains. All texts read in translation.:::NMC101H1::Humanities:
NMC254H1:The Mummy: Technology and Transformation::24L:This course explores the significance of mummies in contexts ranging from ancient Egyptian to modern, tracing the development of Egyptian mummification techniques and the roles and uses of mummies as transformative elements allowing access to the afterlife, sources of information about ancient individuals, characters in literature and film, and objects for display in museums.:::::Humanities:
NMC255H1:Love, Battle, and Wit: Classics of Premodern Arabic Literature::24L:This course surveys the premodern Arabic literary heritage, from pre-Islamic poetry to literature of the Mamluk period, focusing on texts that remained influential sometimes until the present day. Students read classic works in translation each week, while discussion focuses on social context and close reading. Throughout, we note the development of literary forms over time, and the way authors reference previous works. Readings include: the animal fable book Kalila wa Dimna, excerpts from anecdote collections (adab), multilingual Andalusi songs (muwashshah), the linguistically playful trickster tales called maqamat, an obscene shadow play by Ibn Daniyal, popular epic, and some of the most famous poems by Labid, Jarir, Abu Nuwas, Abu Tammam, al-Mutanabbi, and Ibn Nubata.:::1.0 credit in Humanities/BR=1 or 2::Humanities:
NMC256H1:1001 Nights Around the World::24L:The 1001 Nights has had many lives, in many languages, and across many media. This course starts off with a detailed reading, in translation, of one of the oldest surviving Arabic versions of the text, with consideration of its literary and social context, and its sources. We then move forward in time to examine how the 1001 Nights was expanded, adapted, and disseminated from then until today. A key transformation moment occurred between 1704-1717 with the publication of Antoine Gallandâs French version, composed with the input of Syrian storyteller Hanna Diab. This version was widely disseminated and became a basis for most subsequent modern adaptations. We consider adaptations both before and after this turning point, including manuscripts, translations, novels, ballets, short stories, and films produced around the world. Throughout, we consider the politics and aesthetics of these historical translations, adaptations, and transformations.:::1.0 credit in Humanities/BR=1 or 2::Humanities:
NMC257H1:Vice and Virtue in Biblical Traditions::24L:This course examines the formation and development of ancient Jewish literary traditions, centering around complex narrative and poetic figures such as Eve, Abraham, Moses, David, Esther, Job, and Lady Wisdom.

NMC258H1:The Book of Kings: Persian Myth, History, and Art::24L:The Shahnameh, or Book of Kings, is the single most important book in Iranian national culture and one of the great epics of world literature. Composed in Persian by the poet Ferdowsi in the late 10thâearly 11th centuries, it had a deep and lasting impact not only on Iran, but also on those cultures that came under the influence of Persian language, literature, and courtly traditions. The course examines, in English translation, the Shahnamehâs presentation of the history of the mythical dynasties of the ancient kings of Iran from the creation of the world to the Sasanians, the last historical dynasty to rule Iran before the Muslim Arab conquests.

NMC260H1:Why the Ancient Near East? Investigating the Great Transformations in Pre- and Proto- History::48L:This is an experiential course that asks what it would have been like for people in the ancient Near East as their world underwent the profound changes wrought by domestication, farming, urbanism, and state formation. We focus on the sensory experiences of the body, and their effect upon the mind, by reconstructing and using spaces and objects that have come to define the archaeological periods from 10,000 to 2500 BCE. From circular communal buildings and the constraints and possibilities they offer, to replastering skulls and making hand-held figurines, to the performance of a ritual text, we link traditional teaching with walking a mile in ancient footwear. Participation in this course requires an active imagination and a willingness to get physical.:::::Humanities:

This course provides a comprehensive survey of the origins and rise of political leadership in the Near East from its beginnings in the Neolithic period to the famous kings and military leaders of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylon. Sources consulted include archaeological data (architecture, monuments, narrative art) as well as historical sources. The course is intended as an introduction to a broader understanding of the mechanisms that result in the formation of political power structures. Although it focuses on the ancient Near East, the course will discuss parallels from other parts of the world, both ancient and modern, that are relevant to understanding manifestations of political power in our present-day world.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC267H1:Everyday Life in Ancient Egypt::24L/12T:The course focuses on lived experience for people from many different socio-economic levels in ancient Egypt. Through the analysis of archaeological and mortuary evidence, artifacts, and human, animal, and plant remains we will explore the daily lives of Egyptians over time as the natural, social and technological landscape changed, posing questions such as what they ate, how they made things, what kinds of social connections they formed, how they defined their identities, what kind of houses and village, town, or urban settings they lived in, what things they feared, how they died, and what they might have believed. We will look at remains from settlements like Hierakonpolis, Abydos, Giza, Kahun, Tell el-Dab'a, Amarna, Deir el-Medina, and Thebes in detail to understand aspects of the lives of the people who inhabited them.:::NMC101H1:NMC362Y1:Humanities:

We begin with the origins of the piety movement in early Islam, and the ways in which it responded to late antique Christian monasticism. We then examine the emergence of classical Sufism in the 9th century, its basic concepts and practices, the rise of saints, the formation of Sufi orders, the social and cultural context for key developments, as well as the reasons for the contested legacy of Sufism in the modern world. Major figures for discussion include Rabi'a, Junayd, Hallaj, Ghazali, Ibn Arabi, and Rumi.:::::Humanities:
NMC274H1:The Turks in History: From Nomads of the Steppe Frontier to Islamic Rulers::24L:The course examines the roles of Turks and other primarily nomadic peoples as raiders, migrants, slave-soldiers, and empire-builders in the ancient and medieval history of Eurasia (including Central Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe) and in the formation of the Islamic world. Topics covered include long-distance economic and cultural contacts (âsilk roadsâ) facilitated by âsteppe empiresâ; the Islamization of the Turks and their gradual takeover of Iranian, Arab, and other Muslim lands; lifeways (especially pastoral nomadism); the relationship between nomadic and sedentary societies; political structures; steppe warfare; the role of physical geography and the environment. Students explore the histories and landscape geographies of Turks through fascinating primary sources and internet resources. The course illustrates the key role that Turks played in the formation of the modern world on the Eurasian continent.:::NMC103H1:NMC274Y1:Humanities:
NMC275H1:The Mongol Empire and the World It Made::24L:Most of Eurasia (the Middle East, East and South Asia, Eastern Europe) was once incorporated into the Mongol Empire and greatly influenced by Mongol rule. It may be said that the beginnings of modern history on the Eurasian continent were shaped by the impact of the Mongols and their non-Mongol (mainly Turkic) partners. This course explores the history of the pan-Eurasian empire founded by Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) in the 13th century and the smaller empires into which it devolved: Yuan China-Mongolia, Chaghatayid Mongolia-Central Asia, Ilkhanid Iran-Anatolia, and the Golden Horde Eastern Europe-Western Siberia. The course also surveys various post-Mongol successor states, such as the Timurid and Mughal Empires, and the Kazakh, Uzbek, and Crimean Tatar Khanates, as well as touches upon important non-Chinggisid successor polities, such as Muscovy-Russia and Slavic Cossacks.

Starting with the situation on the eve of the Crusades, we trace broader patterns in Islamic history through the emergence of various sultanates (including the dynasty of Salah al-Din Ayyubi and the Mamluks) as well as regional dynamics from North Africa and Spain in the West to Iran and India in the East.:::NMC103H1:NMC273Y1:Humanities:
NMC284H1:Judaism and Feminism: Legal Issues from Menstruation to Ordination::24L:Agitation for change exists in religious practice worldwide in areas of access, status, inclusion, and egalitarianism. Traditional religion is often in conflict with egalitarian modernity. This sometimes results in difficulties with religious identification. This course will explore the interaction between feminism and Judaism. We will examine how Jewish law (halakhah) sometimes conflicts with ideas of egalitarianism particularly in legal disabilities for women such as divorce, lack of access to high-level Torah study, and discrimination in public religious roles. The traditional exemption of women from the obligation of Torah study had great impact on womenâs religious responsibility and status. Various movements within Judaism competed in efforts to resolve these difficulties. In this course we will consider to what extent inclusion and egalitarianism have become complementary to traditional Judaism.:::::Humanities:
NMC289H1:Introduction to Coptic Studies::24L:Overview of the history of the Copts from political, religious, social and economic perspectives.

Students will read travel narratives, autobiographies, and fictional texts that chronicle encounters with the Arab-Islamic worldâs cultural âothers.â The course first examines travel narratives from the medieval Islamic period, including al-Sirafiâs travels to India and China, and Ibn Fadlanâs encounters with peoples inhabiting lands north of the Abbasid Empire, such as the Vikings. Students then consider how travel narratives in the modern period are transformed due to radical changes in the balance of power between Europe and the Middle East, first reading 19th-century travel narratives to Paris (al-Tahtawi), and then focusing on 20th-century texts that narrate the travels of Arab men and women to Europe and North America (Leila Ahmed, Sayyid Qutb, Nawal El Saadawi). Students will also read texts that depict encounters with non-Arabs within the modern Arab world, such as literary depictions of American oil workers in the Arab Gulf (Munif).

The course surveys the reigns of the kings of the Sasanian empire (3rdâ7th centuries); traces the progress of the Muslim Arab conquests in the mid-7th century that resulted in the Persian empireâs collapse and the gradual Islamization of its population; and examines the subsequent formation of regional Iranian dynasties that were instrumental in the creation of a new Perso-Islamic cultural identity.:::NMC280H1:NMC348Y1:Humanities:
NMC341H1:Safavid Iran: Reign of the Shahs::24L:The course focuses on the period of the Safavid dynasty (16thâ18th centuries) which represented a watershed in the history of Iran not only because of its adoption and promotion of Shiâism as the state religion, but also on account of its fostering an imperial court culture that patronized the arts and architecture. The reigns of the Safavid shahs will be examined from the point of view of their political, religious, economic, and cultural history, as well as their relationship to the polities that immediately preceded them and their interactions with the contemporary Muslim states they neighboured, in particular, the Ottomans in the west and the Mughals in the east.:::NMC274H1,  NMC340H1:NMC348Y1:Humanities:

NMC365H1:Women and Gender in Egyptian Archaeology::36S:The course explores issues related to gender within the ancient Egyptian context and investigates the activities of women through the study of many different kinds of archaeological and material evidence. We'll build a foundation for this work with an overview of current developments in gender theory and consider their applications for research on ancient Egyptian society and culture. No prior knowledge of theoretical approaches is expected. From this basis, we'll go on to consider how archaeological material can contribute to the understanding of gender roles and examine how excavators may unconsciously impose their own gender perspectives on ancient contexts, creating biased views of ancient societies that become entrenched in scholarly tradition. The same methods of critical analysis will inform our study of women in ancient Egypt, incorporating archaeological data and artifactual material that can inform our understanding of the complex roles that women played in Egyptian culture, society, and religious practice.:3.0 credits in BR=1/2/3::NMC101H1 or ( NMC343H1/ NMC344H1) or  NMC251H1::Humanities:
