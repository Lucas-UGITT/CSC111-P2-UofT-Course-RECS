CLA160H1:Introduction to Classical Studies::36L/10T:An introduction to major themes in the development of Greek and Roman civilization, literature and culture.:::::Humanities:
CLA195H1:Herakles::24S:At the centre of this course stands one of the most famous ancient heroes, Herakles. Through a close analysis of literary sources and visual artifacts, we will examine the representation of Herakles in various texts and contexts (as a hero ridding the world of monsters, a tragic figure gone mad, a precocious child, a comic glutton, a transvestite, etc.) as well as the different usages to which this figure was put in Greco-Roman culture. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA196H1:Animals::24S:This course offers a survey of some of ways in which animals enter into the texts produced by Greco-Roman antiquity. The deployment of animals is varied. But most discussions of animals - whether scientific, literary, allegorical or practical - tend to shed a great deal of light on the question of what the people who produced these accounts thought it meant to be human. Animals are simultaneously our doubles, neighbors, slaves, and tools. And even as strangers, they speak to our sense of self. We will also consider this ancient material in light of the way we talk about animals today. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA197H1:Craft and Wisdom::24S:Technê [craft, art, or expertise] is a powerful concept in ancient Greek thought. To have a craft is to have a kind of wisdom; but we may need further wisdom to use craft well. This course explores the significance of technê and its complex relation to sophia, wisdom, in early Greek thought. Topics include the divine wisdom (and craft) of the poet, the mysterious Seven Sages, the mythic origins of the crafts, craft and the city, debates about bogus and borderline cases, and the sophistic and Socratic idea of an 'art of politics'. Readings will include Hesiod’s Works and Days, sophistic fragments, medical texts, and several brief Platonic dialogues. Comparisons may also be explored to contemporary theories of skill and technology, and similar ideas in ancient Chinese philosophy. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA198H1:Homer's Odyssey down through Time::24S:This course will survey creative works inspired by Homer's Odyssey. First we will read through the Odyssey, contextualizing the Homeric epic within the larger story of the Trojan War and the subsequent heroic return in the "Epic Cycle." Then we will study various "receptions" of the Odyssey, ancient and modern. Ancient works will include the satyr play Cyclops by Euripides and portrayals of a love-sick Cyclops in Theocritus and Ovid. In True Story Lucian calls Odysseus a liar but rivals his travel tale with episodes placed on the moon and inside a whale. Modern works include Atwood's Penelopiad, Walcott's stage version of the Odyssey, and the film "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" Themes will include travel literature, truth and lying, localization of the wanderings of Odysseus, culture clash, and the definition of home. All this material, various in date, media, and fidelity to their Homeric source, will provide us with a well-rounded sense of how the Odyssey has been re-imagined over the ages. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
CLA199H1:The “Decline and Fall” of the Roman Empire::24S:After a high water mark of territorial reach and economic success in the middle of the 2nd century CE, the Roman Empire eventually disintegrated. How? Why? When? In this course, we will consider some of the historical features that may have contributed to its political collapse, and we will consider some modern scholarly analyses from Edward Gibbon (late 18th century) to the present. But we will also investigate “decline and fall” as a narrative trope. Why is this story arc always with us? Who decides what qualifies as “decline”? Is the “fall” of some systems necessarily a bad thing? Among the topics to be considered in the context of the Later Roman Empire are several of relevance in the modern world, not least: climate change, disease, human migration, religious difference, and economic inequality. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:

DTS199H1:Superman and Other Migrants::24S:From the 1938 debut of Superman until the spate of recent autobiographical graphic novels by immigrants and children of immigrants, the development of the comic and graphic novel form has been intricately bound up with the diaspora experience.

DTS200Y1:Introduction to Diaspora and Transnational Studies I::48L:What is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.::::DTS201H1,  DTS202H1:Humanities, Social Science:

DTS310H1:Transnational Toronto::24L:Toronto is a city increasingly configured through transnational connections and practices. It is a city defined by the scale at which its residents live their lives; a scale that is no longer (if it ever was) parochial, but extends across time and space to connect people and practice across a multitude of locales. Contemporary understandings of Toronto can only be reached through adopting a transnational lens. This course will examine the processes that have produced Toronto as a transnational city over time, including the dynamics of immigration and mobility, experiences of alienation, the global extension of capitalism, and the (re)formation of communities grounded in the complex dynamics of identities produced in a space that is both ‘home’ and away’. We will also explore the specific practices, and connections that produce “Toronto” as a space that transcends its physical geographic boundaries and is continually reproduced in and through the flows of people, capital, objects, ideas, - and the many forces that reproduce and reconfigure these flows.:Completion of 9.0 credits::DTS200Y1::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS311H1:Fun in Diaspora::24L:From parkour to “Baby Shark” remixes, concepts and practices surrounding fun, entertainment, and pleasure transcend cultural boundaries, reveal the reach of globalization, and help facilitate the maintenance of transnational communities through shared activities.

Additionally, the class will consider the relationship between entertainment practices and politics, marketing, and social movements. Cases examined will include K-pop fandom, bucket challenges, social media memes, and global YouTube phenomena.:DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS312H1:Exile::24S:Historically used to describe both voluntary departure and enforced banishment from a city, today, "Exile" is perhaps most famously associated with both the Jewish and the Palestinian condition. But exile is also a state of being, one that is creative, critical, and full of meaning-making. This class posits “Exile” as a conceptual framework through which to think through the 21st-century condition of migration and diaspora. Through foundational texts and historic case studies, particularly drawn from East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, we will consider how exile has been deployed in order to bring together diverse situations under a unifying theory of both individual and collective experience.:DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS314H1:Citizenship and Multiculturalism::24S:This course examines approaches to belonging and distinction that accompany different models of citizenship.

Areas of emphasis will vary, but may include topics such as authenticity and assimilation; ethno-nationalism; immigration and naturalization policy; indigeneity; insurgency; legacies of colonialism; mass media and popular culture; policing and surveillance; racial stratification; transnational markets; and xenophobia.:DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:

DTS410H1:Diasporic Foodways::24S:Food links people across space and time. As it spirals outward from parochial sites of origin to articulate with new sites, actors and scales, it assumes new substance and meaning in new locales. This movement of food gives rise to new ‘foodways’ to help us to understand the past in terms of temporally connected sites of intense interaction. Food also plays a strong role in shaping translocal identities. As peoples have moved in the world, food has played a central role in (re)defining who they are, reproducing myth and ritual, and bounding diasporic communities. This course seeks to address questions surrounding the dynamics of the food ‘we’ eat, the ways in which ‘we’ eat, the meaning ‘we’ give to eating, and the effect of eating in a transnational world. Recognizing that culinary culture is central to diasporic identifications, the focus is on the place of food in the enduring habits, rituals, and everyday practices that are collectively used to produce and sustain a shared sense of diasporic cultural identity.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS411H1:Transnational Justice::24S:This course explores the intersection between local conceptions of justice and their transnational and institutional circulations. It interrogates competing meanings of justice and examines the varied practices of actors engaged in justice making domains. From international human rights, to transitional justice and truth and reconciliation, to international legal and traditional justice formulations, the course offers students an opportunity to learn about and critically reflect on the processes and purposes through which justice conceptions are structured, implemented and being contested in the contemporary period. Topics include: theories of transnationalism, transnational justice, social injustice, law and culture, universalism, racism and social inequality.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS412H1:The Diasporic Imagination::24S:This course focuses on echoes of diasporic and transnational life in artistic work, and on the significance of aesthetic production to the formation of diasporic and transnational worlds. How have practices, producers, and works of art illuminated the particularities of diasporic life? How do conventions of genre, performance, and tradition shape experiences of borders and crossings? Areas of emphasis will vary but may spotlight particular historical and geographic contexts, and may foreground one or more form, including film, poetry, fiction, music, and dance.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS413H1:Global Sexualities::24S:Sexuality is a complex interplay of desires, attractions, interests, and modes of behavior and has diverse meanings in different societies and cultures. In this course, we will examine the notion of sexuality as well as gender identity and expression from an interdisciplinary perspective that is rooted in ethnography. A cross-cultural study of sexuality and gender identity within global and transnational contexts will provide students with an understanding of how the intersections of culture, community, as well as social and political factors affect individuals’ sexual choices and understandings of gender. A particular focus in this course will be experiences of sexuality and gender within diasporic communities.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1/ SDS380H1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS414H1:Money on the Move::24S:In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, industry and finance matured together, pushing people into motion around the world. The instruments of long-distance trade, like insurance, credit and debt, connected cities and continents in new and sometimes unsettling ways. The free movement of goods and cash was mirrored by restrictions on migration to some parts of the world and by forced or coerced migration to others. This course explores the history of the rise of global capitalism at a human scale, exploring how financialization, industrialization and imperialism overlapped and intertwined, and how the remaking of the world in the image of capital weighed on human lives.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS415H1:Diaspora at Home::24S:What is the relationship between diaspora and domesticity? What does it mean to inhabit the position of the stranger not in the public life of the city, but in the private sphere of the household? This course approaches questions of migration, labour, and foreignness through the prism of the home. We consider the international phenomenon of migrant domestic labour and how it shapes social and family relations, both in countries of origin such as the Philippines and Ethiopia, as well as in countries of employment such as Canada and Lebanon. But we also reflect on how migration radically transforms life inside the home, affecting what it means to be a parent, a child, or a partner. In doing so we draw upon diverse representations of “the family”, kinship, and intimacy across both the humanities and the social sciences.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS416H1:Wars, Diaspora and Music::24S:The course explores how composers, performers, songwriters and audiences made sense of traumatic and violent events that they experienced, such as ethnic conflicts, wars, exile and displacement, through music. We will also look at how government ideologies employ music during wars. The case studies will include stories of Jewish, Palestinian, Afghan, Romani, Korean, Rwandan and other diasporas severely affected by wars and violence.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:
DTS417H1:9 to 5: A Transnational History of the Working Day::24S:Work is a central preoccupation in human life and culture, and the working day – measured in daylight, in shifts, or in tasks and ‘gigs’ – is, for most people, the basic unit of work. A ‘day’s work’ is so ubiquitous that it seems natural – but it is not – the offices, worksites, hourly wages and everyday forms of discipline and surveillance that shape working lives have a history. This course explores the transnational and diasporic histories of working life, from plantations to factories to offices to informal work at the margins of global industrial capitalism.:14.0 credits including  DTS200Y1::::Humanities, Social Science:

EAS193H1:What is “The Yellow Peril”?::24L:This course explores the old and new reincarnations of “the Yellow Peril” complex. The 2020 naming of COVID-19 as “the Chinese virus” by the U.S. president Donald Trump has provoked much anger, criticism, and concerns for anti-Asian violence and the reagitation of “The Yellow Peril” panic. Yet the imaginaries of “the Yellow Peril” and their power effects have been engrained in our political modernity, the Enlightenment ideas, and its institutions in a much more complex, far-reaching, and intersecting ways in East Asia and beyond.

Along the way we consider the social dimensions of Chinese book culture by considering the scribes, binders, engravers, printers, publishers, distributors and readers who produced, circulated and consumed Chinese books. The course draws on the methods and theories developed in diverse fields of study, including book history, philology, literacy studies and archive studies, to examine different chapters in the history of the Chinese book.:EAS209H1::::Humanities:
EAS427H1:The Kyoto School: Now, Then, and To Come::24S:This course begins with a careful study of a group of modern Japanese thinkers (Nishida, Tanabe, Nishitani) known as the Kyoto School (Kyoto Gaku-ha) who developed their original philosophies by creatively combining the spiritual and intellectual traditions of Mahayana Buddhism with the Western philosophical tradition, most notably with the work of Hegel and Heidegger. We focus on the concept of “Absolute Nothingness” and how it is similar and different to Western ontologies of Being as well as what it implies for political, psychological, spiritual, and artistic life. We also study significant criticisms of the Kyoto School (Tosaka, Miki, et al.) and re-evaluate how such a project persists today as well as how it might make a claim on possible futures.:EAS209H1::::Humanities:
EAS431H1:Advanced Seminar in Japanese Cinema::24S:The focus ranges from the examination of cross-cultural theoretical problems (such as Orientalism) to a director-based focus, from the examination of genre (such as documentary or the category of genre itself) to the way film intersects with other cultural forms and technologies (such as video and new media).:EAS209H1 and  EAS242H1/ EAS243H1::::Humanities:

EAS433H1:Chinese Cultural Studies Seminar: Land::24S:Land as part of the Earth is repeatedly reconfigured in China throughout the 20th century, first by the Reformists and pioneers of the New Culture, then by geoscientists and writers, as well as by economic planners and social thinkers of recent decades. This seminar provides a critical review of this multi-dimensional cultural and conceptual practice of land, as well as its possible role in the era of climate change.:EAS209H1::EAS289H1:::
