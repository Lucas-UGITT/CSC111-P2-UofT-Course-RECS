GER195H1:Cities, Real and Imagined (E)::24S:Cities have been described as places of desire and places of fear. They pulse with life, bringing together people from different class, gender, and ethnic backgrounds, simultaneously giving rise to a sense of freedom and oppression, a sense of belonging and alienation. This course will explore the city as a physical reality that shapes our lives, but is also a projection of our deepest imaginings. Through readings of philosophical and sociological texts by influential theorists of the city, we will consider various ancient and modern conceptions of urban space and subjectivity. Alongside these theoretical readings, we will also examine literary and filmic representations of the city as a space of desire, memory and power. All readings and class discussions are in English. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
GER196H1:"Es war einmal auf Deutsch" - Learning German with Fairy Tales::24S:Grimms' Fairy Tales – we all know and love them. But what do we really know? Which versions are we familiar with? Most likely not the ones by the Brothers Grimm. And certainly not in German! This course is a journey into the mythical German Schwarzwald, a place of wolves and witches, the realm of the fantastic. It is not a traditional language course, as we won’t be cramming grammar and vocabulary, at least not excessively. Rather, we will learn German playfully by reading, analyzing and acting out original folk tales, their Romantic adaptations and modern retellings. In the process we will enrich our understanding of German language and culture. Please note that basic knowledge of German is required to participate in this course (i.e. at least one year of solid high school instruction). Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:One year of German instruction, or equivalent::::Humanities:
GER197H1:Poets and Power: Art under the Nazis (E)::24S:Did you know that Hitler was a failed artist? Goebbels a poet? Göring a collector of art? That there was an orchestra in Auschwitz? In this course we will examine the ways in which politics and aesthetics intertwined in Nazism: the fascist cult of beauty; the theatrics of political propaganda; anti-Semitic entertainment films; and the eroticization of the Führer-figure. We will investigate this marriage of beauty and violence, and ask ourselves: What made the “Third Reich” so attractive to so many? Beginning with the great aesthetic movements from the pre-Nazi era, we will analyze Hitler’s 1937 ban on “degenerate,” modern art, as well as his return to Greek and Roman images of beauty. Throughout the course, we will consider some of the high points of German culture – in philosophy, music, and literature – and ask: How did a society that produced such works of genius also create Nazism and the Holocaust? Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
GER198H1:Technology and the Human in German Literature and Thought (E)::24S:Technology has changed our lives, and scientific knowledge has enhanced human capacities. At the same time, though, this development is also experienced as a threat. Killing missiles, controlling 'Big Brothers,' and monstrous creatures are often considered the flip-side of technological advancement. This course asks: What is the relationship between technology and the "human"? Can there be progress of technology without a regress of humanity? Or is technology liberating us from the bonds of nature? We will discuss possible answers to these questions by looking at key texts in German literature, philosophy, and cultural history from the eighteenth century to Post-Modernity. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
GER199H1:The Pleasure of Reading: Reading as Self-Emancipation in the German Literary Tradition (E)::24S:In this course we read some of the most enjoyable plots and stories in German Literature and examine how the pleasure of reading sets readers free to re-imagine themselves and the world released from everyday pressures and the repressive weight of the status quo. Readings are all in English translation and include texts by Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, Keller, Heine and Kafka. Restricted to first-year students.

GER251H1:German and European Cinema (E)::24P/24S:This course examines German cinema against the backdrop of European film history. European films share common references points anchored in the cataclysms of two world wars, and have also negotiated analogous postwar transformations in family life, urbanization, the regional and the national, cultural identity, labour relations, post-socialist societies, and state security. A comparative approach enables examination of what binds German cinema to European cinema – shared histories and political concerns--as well as what is nationally unique and distinctive. By matching select films with readings from social theory, cultural studies, and film studies, we will compare and contrast these socio-historical concerns while also attending to the medium specificities of film style, aesthetics, and narrative form.:::::Humanities:

GGR101H1:Histories of Environmental Change::24L:This course will investigate geological, biological and archaeological evidence of environmental change. We will examine the processes that have driven and will drive environmental change and how past societies have shaped and responded to these changes. The emphasis is on the current interglacial period, or Holocene, and how shifts in population and technologies have affected human-environment interactions. As language of the Holocene gives way, for many, to that the Anthropocene, the implications of environmental change for present and future human societies will be our concluding concern.:::::Science:

GGR197H1:Nature, Conservation and Justice::24S:Every day we read about climate change, species extinction, environmental degradation and the need for nature conservation. It is increasingly becoming apparent that the environmental problems that we face today arise from a deeper crisis relating to human ways of viewing and connecting to nature. This course asks how we can rework human ways of relating to nature, while querying the idea of “nature” and questioning the dominant approaches to nature conservation. It asks how can concerns for nature and for other species be balanced with that for human livelihoods and well-being? How can inequalities with regards to the distribution of environmental goods and bads be reduced? How are citizens and communities in the different parts of the world struggling against environmental injustice and to protect their local environments? How do these place-based movement demand justice and what visions do they articulate for a more just and sustainable world? How do indigenous worldviews offer conceptual resources for rethinking nature and our ways of relating to nature?

It seeks to extend our understandings of migrants, borders, and mobility, and it explores the processes through which mobility is produced, delimited and structured. We will consider the transnational politics of migration, the militarization of border zones, and the political spaces of migrant displacement, dispossession, and dislocation. The seminar readings focus on classical paradigms as well as emerging approaches in immigration studies. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:

GGR324H1:Spatial Political Economy::24L:This course aims to explore how economic agents act and interact in space and how this creates subdivisions within the global, national and regional political economy. In a largely conceptual and interdisciplinary manner, the course investigates the role of institutions in the relational economy and the spatial construction of the political economy. Institutions are viewed as formal or informal stabilizations of economic interaction. Questions which guide the analysis are related to how institutions are established, how they evolve, how they impact economic action, and how they are changed through political and economic action at different spatial scales. Through this, the course introduces a relational and spatial perspective to the analysis of economic action and institutions. This perspective is based on the assumption that economic action is situated in socio-institutional contexts, evolves along particular paths and, at the same time, remains fundamentally contingent. Topics to be discussed include the social construction of economic space, industrial organization and location, the establishment and maintenance of economic networks, as well as processes of firm formation, learning and knowledge creation.:8.0 credits::One of  ECO101H1,  GGR112H1,  GGR221H1,  GGR251H1,  GGR252H1:POL371H1:Social Science:

Cities are often at the forefront of these transformations, both in feeling their effects but also initiating responses. How might we reimagine our cities in a way that promotes thriving and equitable ecosystems? What tools exist in the policy landscape to initiate needed changes? What innovative responses are emerging to confront the challenges of increased flooding, rising temperatures, habitat fragmentation, and food insecurity? How might we reimagine an urban commons? With a primary focus on Canadian cities, in this course we explore the ways divergent conceptualizations of urban-nature have informed policies and practices drawing largely from critical, political ecology, and Indigenous perspectives; the policy landscape that informs current urban planning; and new and innovative approaches that help us to reshape and reimagine our relationships to urban nature, including initiatives led by municipalities, non-government organizations and citizens groups.:8.0 credits::GGR223H1:GGR300H1 (Topics: Managing Urban Natures), offered in Fall 2017:Social Science:
GGR354H1:Infrastructure::24L:Infrastructure is the term that describes the transportation systems, sewers, pipes, and power lines that provide urban dwellers with necessary public services. In recent years, billions of dollars of public money have been spent upgrading existing infrastructure, and planning and delivering new facilities. Infrastructure has many impacts on the way that people in cities live. The way that infrastructure systems are planned, financed, and distributed impact on environmental sustainability, job creation, social equity, economic development, and urban livability. Moreover, infrastructure has the potential to both serve existing populations, and shape the way that future communities are built. Through lectures, discussions, workshops, readings of scholarly articles and case studies, the course will aim to engage students in the key topics and debates related to the provision of urban infrastructure.

GGR428H1:Alternative Economies: Another Economy is Possible::24S:Between neoliberal capitalism and state socialism are many innovative enterprise models to empower people and protect the planet. This course compares the range of such enterprise models across the three factors of production – land, labour, and capital – from community companies to cooperatives, peer-to-peer non-profit technologies, credit unions, community land trusts and beyond. Planning/policy's role in their development in different spaces and places, both urban and rural, is evaluated. Relevant multi-disciplinary and geographical conceptual frameworks -- alternative, diverse, and community economies; the commons/commoning; community control; economic democracy; social and solidarity economies; and feminist and BIPOC economic frameworks -- are also compared.:10.0 credits::Two of:  GGR124H1,  GGR221H1,  GGR324H1,  GGR328H1,  GGR339H1,  GGR357H1,  GGR359H1::Social Science:
GGR429H1:Innovation and Governance::24S:The course focuses on a broad range of topics related to innovation and governance, such as (i) technological change and its social and economic consequences, (ii) the spatial effects which result from this, and (iii) the necessities for economic policies at different territorial levels. Since international competitiveness of industrialized economies cannot be based on cost advantages alone, future growth in the knowledge-based economy will be increasingly associated with capabilities related to creativity, knowledge generation and innovation. As a consequence, questions regarding the performance in innovation and effectiveness of policy support become decisive at the firm level, regional level and national level. The first part of the course deals with conceptual foundations of innovation processes, such as evolutionary and institutional views of innovation. In the second part, national configurations of innovation processes are investigated. The third part deals with innovation at the subnational level, focusing on regional clustering, institution building, multilevel governance, and regionalized innovation systems.:10.0 credits::One of  GGR221H1,  GGR251H1,  GGR324H1,  GGR326H1,  GGR328H1,  GGR374H1:POL408H1:Social Science:
GGR430H1:Geographies of Markets::36S:Focuses on actually-existing markets and their geographically-mediated formation and assemblage. Explores how markets are produced, stabilized, reshaped and fall apart at multiple geographic scales. We examine issues such as the debates on states versus markets, embeddedness of markets, neoliberalism and moral justification of markets, varieties of capitalism, regionally variegated capitalism, post-socialist market transitions, and the dynamic evolution of market institutions and economic landscapes.:10.0 credits including at least 1.0 credit in 300+ level Geography (SOC SCI/BR=3)::GGR220H1/ GGR221H1,  GGR326H1:GGR400H1 (2013-14):Social Science:
GGR431H1:Regional Dynamics::24L:Economic activity, and related indices of socioeconomic well-being and human capital, have always tended to concentrate in space, leaving specific regions to be classified as “creative”, “developed”, or “core” regions and others as “have-not”, “less-developed, “peripheral”, or “marginal” regions. As a result, regional economic change has been very difficult to fully explain (and certainly predict) using conventional (orthodox) theories and methods. This course examines the theoretical linkage between related trends in terms of globalization, vertical disintegration, specialization, innovation, and the locational behaviour of firms. We will focus on the seemingly counter-intuitive finding that regional economic change in a time of increasing global interdependence is increasingly dependent on the local context. Topics will include evolutionary economic geography, path dependence, economic clusters, learning regions, the role of institutions, knowledge spill-overs, and the geography of innovation, among others. We will see why the economic activity is becoming ever more concentrated in space even as it globalizes. The course makes extensive use of empirical case studies from around the globe.:10.0 credits including  GGR221H1/ GGR251H1::GGR326H1,  GGR270H1. A statistics course ( GGR270H1 or other) will be an asset.::Social Science:

HIS110Y1:History of the Indian Ocean World::48L/20T:This course introduces you to the connected and interdependent world people who lived between the present day cities of Dakar, in West Africa, and Jakarta, in Indonesia, from about 1000 to the present. We explore in this class the three "C"s which have linked human experience in Africa and Asia via routes which connected the Indian Ocean World: Connectedness, Contingency, and Cosmopolitanism. We study how people who lived more than a thousand years before our time transported ideas, products, and scripts by land and sea via routes that connected large parts of Africa, Central & South Asia, and East and Southeast Asia, and their histories. The land and sea routes connected these communities and the cosmopolitan outlook of the hosts provided the contingent conditions for a Buddhist monks to travel from all over China to Southern and Southeast Asia; Muslim scholars to travel from West Africa to Indonesia; and merchants and writers to move within these worlds. Human migration, economic trade, and religious conversion had linked the lands and the seas, making it possible for our imams, merchants, monks, and servants to traverse these territories, across the Africa and Asia. This vibrant and wealthy world of African and Asian thinkers, merchants, leaders, and communities became the envy of the world, and as late as the seventeenth century, these crazy rich Africans and Asians dominated the world as it was known. We'll see how history is contingent--and that human migration, economic exploitation, lack of reciprocity, and legacies of European colonial racism have disrupted the cosmopolitan worlds of the Indian Ocean. The world is different today, but more than three quarters of the human population still live in Africa and Asia--see the richness of their worlds as it was for thousands of years, and what will be left for the people of this world as climate change makes the seas rise.::::HIS100Y1,  HIS101Y1,  HIS102Y1,  HIS103Y1,  HIS106Y1,  HIS107Y1,  HIS108Y1,  HIS109Y1:Humanities:
HIS111H1:History and Social Media::24L/10T:In the 21st century, the idea of fake news and its rapid circulation via social media shapes how humans perceive events around them. The issue of what counts as authentic, or “fake,” is not simply a recent phenomenon, but is central to the idea of history itself. What materials get saved, whose stories get told, and why are some stories represented as more important than others? By examining specific examples of “misinformation”–propaganda, suppression of information, and hidden actors-- in a global context, this course explores how historical narrative and public memory have been shaped by the collection and valuation of texts, experiences, and material objects, all themes central to the craft of history.:::::Humanities:

HIS190H1:Freedom Schools::24S:This first-year seminar explores radical traditions of education beyond and in resistance to formal schooling. Transnational in scope—and journeying from the late nineteenth century to the present day—we will study the pedagogical innovations and grassroots struggles of anarchic youth, guerrilla intellectuals, and feminist revolutionaries who used education broadly, and historical inquiry in particular, as tools for empowerment and collective liberation. Focusing on primary sources from archives of anticapitalist, antiracist and anticolonial movements, we will investigate traditions of self-teaching and co-learning, genealogies of critical and transformative pedagogies, the construction of decolonial survival and supplementary schools, student mobilizations within and against the university, as well as abolitionist education in our contemporary moment. This course invites participants to interrogate the relationship of education to freedom and justice through collective criticism, self-reflection and creative expression.

HIS199H1:Phantom Museums: History and Social Media Archives::24S:What role does social media play in the spread of historical falsehoods? Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube are relatively new, but the hidden power structures that shape their content are not. This course explores the relationship between social media platforms and history in two ways. First, class discussions, workshops, and guest lectures introduce students to overlooked histories of social media itself, including the rise of the early internet and its roots in histories of race, LGBTQ+ expression, sex work, and capitalism. Second, we explore how and why social media platforms promote the spread of historical misinformation, while censoring or burying accurate and important historical content.

HIS200H1:Drunk History::24L/12T:Histories of wine or beer or vodka often focus either on the production of these alcoholic beverages and their role in national or local economies, or on the ways that drinking is part of celebration. But drunkenness enters the historical record in other ways, too—not just as a social lubricant but as a social ill, one associated with intimate violence or violence to the self and with mass protest. From worries about the Gin Craze to race-based restrictions on consumption, from tax policies to policing, this class will consider the many ways that drunkenness has been accepted, denounced, and legislated in societies around the world.::::HIS195H1:Humanities:

HPS340H1:The Limits of Machine Intelligence::24L/11T:With the recent headline-making breakthroughs in deep learning neural networks (DNNs), it might seem that we are on the cusp of living with artificial systems that match or exceed human intelligence. But there remain longstanding philosophical challenges around the definition of intelligence that AI researchers use, how they measure the performance of their systems, and what DNNS could really be capable of, that still need addressing. For example, how close are DNNs to passing the Turing test? How close are we to building general intelligence and what do we need to get us there? How can we draw fair and meaningful comparisons between artificial and biological systems? We will draw on material from the history and philosophy of science to evaluate and inform current debates around the limits of AI. For example, we’ll consider what kinds of explanations DNNs can provide. We’ll also look at how debates between the rationalists and empiricists (e.g. Locke, Hume, and Kant) inform current debates between AI nativists and empiricists.

IRE199H1:Why We Work: Understanding Work Through the Prism of Art & Culture::24S:Why do we work? What does work mean to the average person? These questions are not as straightforward as they appear. We work for the bulk of our lives and most of our days are spent with coworkers who are neither family nor our closest friends, but we often fail to realize how self-defining work really is. This speaks to work’s centrality but also to its invisibility in reflective discourse. However, through “popular” representations of work (e.g., such as in story-telling, cave drawings, hieroglyphs, music, writing, painting, television, film, video games, etc.,) we can begin to better understand the meaning of work and how this has changed over time. Readings in anthropology, history, economics, sociology and employment relations plus film and art criticism will help us explore these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective; assignments will encourage students to reflect on their own experience of work. Developing strong analytical and communication skills is an important goal of the course. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:

We will focus empirically on the rise of radical reformist Islam and evangelical Christianity, the two most dramatically successful forms of religiosity around the world today. We will study the implications for the foreign policies of key nation-states, as well as the forces that have contributed to the prevalence of contestatory religious politics and networks as new and poorly understood global actors. International religious freedom, human rights, the role of media and mediation, the place of religious or theological doctrines or imaginaries in constructing and motivating a range of political goals, many involving the use of violence. We will focus as well on the global spread of extremist forms of religious politics, conspiracy thinking, new online communities that lead to dangerous political outcomes, such as ‘QAnon’ and ‘Plandemic’. Many of the cases will focus on the non-Western world, especially the Middle East and Africa.(Given by the Departments of Political Science and Religion):0.5 credit in POL/ JPI/ RLG courses at the 200+ level, or 1.0 credit in HIS/ PHL/ SOC courses at the 200-level:::JPR364Y1:Social Science:

Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
LIN198H1:Language Diversity::24L:There are estimated to be about 7000 languages currently spoken in the world. What do they have in common? In what ways are they different? This course will explore these questions, covering such topics as meaning, sound systems, the structure of words, the order of words in sentences, question formation, concepts such as subject and object, tense systems, pronoun systems. We will also discuss language loss and revival. Students will develop analytic skills as they consult published grammars and other resources to address these issues. Students will share their findings through oral and written presentation. Examples will be drawn from a wide range of languages. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:

MAT437H1:K-Theory and C* Algebras::36L:The theory of operator algebras was begun by John von Neumann eighty years ago. In one of the most important innovations of this theory, von Neumann and Murray introduced a notion of equivalence of projections in a self-adjoint algebra (*-algebra) of Hilbert space operators that was compatible with addition of orthogonal projections (also in matrix algebras over the algebra), and so gave rise to an abelian semigroup, now referred to as the Murray-von Neumann semigroup. Later, Grothendieck in geometry, Atiyah and Hirzebruch in topology, and Serre in the setting of arbitrary rings (pertinent for instance for number theory), considered similar constructions. The enveloping group of the semigroup considered in each of these settings is now referred to as the K-group (Grothendieck's terminology), or as the Grothendieck group. Among the many indications of the depth of this construction was the discovery of Atiyah and Hirzebruch that Bott periodicity could be expressed in a simple way using the K-group. Also, Atiyah and Singer famously showed that K-theory was important in connection with the Fredholm index. Partly because of these developments, K-theory very soon became important again in the theory of operator algebras. (And in turn, operator algebras became increasingly important in other branches of mathematics.) The purpose of this course is to give a general, elementary, introduction to the ideas of K-theory in the operator algebra context. (Very briefly, K-theory generalizes the notion of dimension of a vector space.) The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications.

MST231H1:On the Move in Mediaeval Eurasia::24L:In this age of constant global travel, it is easy both to forget how much more complicated travel was in earlier periods, and to assume that there was very little of it. In the Mediaeval world, people travelled for work as traders, craftsmen and warriors; they travelled for their spirit as pilgrims; they travelled as migrants and refugees. This course will introduce students to the variety of people on the move in Mediaeval Eurasia, their motives, and the means they used to travel.:::::Humanities:
MST232H1:How to Be a Barbarian: Beard, Battles and Belief at the Dawn of the Middle Ages::24L:Barbarians have caught the modern popular imagination, and they appear to be much the same: hairy warriors who destroyed civilization. The late antique period (c.300–c.600) was a time of transition and the meetings of several cultures. This course examines the so-called barbarians who entered and soon came to rule the former Roman provinces of western Europe in this period. Our particular focus is the cultural, religious, artistic, and socio-economic aspects of barbarian peoples, and how these intersected with the civilization of Rome.:::::Humanities:
MST233H1:Viking Cultures::24L:Everyone thinks they know who the Vikings were. Like many aspects of the middle ages popular in modern life, there is much that is inaccurate about this picture of the Vikings. This course explores how Vikings lived—what sorts of things they did for a living, how they amused and entertained themselves, and what they thought—and moves on to consider their rituals of death and their notions of the afterlife. It will be based both on reading a variety of texts produced by and about the Vikings, as well as looking at various objects they produced that have survived.:::::Humanities:
MST234H1:Women's Lives in Mediaeval Europe::24L:Using an interdisciplinary lens, this course explores the experiences of Mediaeval women. Some attention will be given to subjects such as the idea of the Mediaeval feminine, holiness and femininity, and appropriate feminine behaviour. At the same time, we will look at the social and cultural roles of women in society for instance the gendered ideals of marriage, guild structures, and childrearing.:::::Humanities:
MST242H1:Mediaeval Mythologies and Methodologies::24L:The idea of the ‘middle ages’ is pervasive in Western thought, but only some of what is ‘traditional’ actually happened. This course introduces various interpretations, constrictions, and re-creations. Our analysis will draw on literary texts and their various interdisciplinary interpretations and applications.:::::Humanities:
MST300H1:Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages::24L/12T:Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE), king of Macedon, was one of the most successful military campaigners the world has ever seen. By the time he was thirty, he had established a vast empire stretching from Greece in the west to India in the east. Fantastic stories and legends about Alexander the Great circulated throughout the medieval world, from Iceland to Iran and from Ethiopia to England. In this course, we explore what different representations of the same figure can tell us about the range of medieval cultures. Through the use of digital tools, students and the instructor work together to explore this rich material. We trace the transmission of Alexander’s legend using digital maps. We compare different versions of the same story using text analysis tools. And we curate a small selection of the lavishly-illustrated manuscripts of the Alexander Romance in a digital exhibition.:MST201H1, or  MST202H1, or Permission of Instructor::::Humanities:

MST341H1:Middle Ages by the Numbers::24L:Numbers and their uses often appear to be absolute fact: a thousand dollars is exactly that, not more or less; and if you weigh fifty kilos, that’s what you weigh. But the use and meaning of numbers—for recording and counting dates, money, weights, distances, and myriad other functions—is not, in fact, devoid of cultural, historical, and political context. Mediaeval Europe provided a bewildering range of calendric systems, currencies, systems of measurement, and numerical symbolism was much used in art, music, religious thought, and literature. This course provides an introduction to the various uses of numbers in this period across different regions and cultural contexts.:Completion of 9.0 credits::MST210H1,  MST212H1::Humanities:

MUN101H1:Global Innovation I: Issues and Perspectives::24L:Innovation has always been a key driver of economic growth, population health, and societal success. Transformative change has historically been linked to major innovations such as urban sanitation, pasteurization, the printing press and the industrial revolution. Currently, the opportunity to enhance life chances worldwide relies on innovating for the poor, social innovation, and the ability to harness scientific and technological knowledge. What precisely is innovation? When does innovation happen? Who benefits from innovation? How can innovation be fostered, and how do innovations spread? Relying on major global transformations and country-specific case studies (for example, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel and India), this course examines the drivers of innovation, the political, social, economic, and scientific and technological factors that are critical to promoting innovation and addressing current global challenges, and the consequences of innovation. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:Admission to Munk One::::Social Science:
MUN102H1:Global Innovation II: Challenges and Solutions::24L:Governing public goods has been an age-old concern for social scientists and policymakers alike. This is not surprising since the provision of global public goods is riddled by problems of collective action. In this course, we focus on how to implement solutions through states, markets and communities. The first objective is to familiarize students with the concept of global public goods, the different mechanisms that can provide these goods and the challenges that emerge from lacking incentives to secure their provision. To this end, the course will introduce theories from sociology, political science, philosophy, and history to help us understand different types of governance mechanisms and how they may be used to scale global solutions. Theories can help us explain the tensions between cooperating for the public good at the expense of sacrificing individual goals, or why certain areas of our lives, like the Internet, seem to produce public goods without any formal mechanism of cooperation. The second objective is to use the class and subject of study as an arena to model and practice the kind of learning that is expected of university students. The main skills that the course will help students target and develop are: research (finding, evaluating and assimilating reliable information); writing (developing ideas into logically written arguments); and critical analysis of arguments presented in the readings and debated in class (this includes identifying the key assumptions that are implicit in different theories as well as inherent in our own positions on various questions related to governance).

This course takes a case study approach to dictatorships in Europe in the 20h and 21st centuries. By looking beyond the frequently studied examples of Germany, Italy and the USSR, the class examines less-studied examples in the Balkans and Central Europe such as Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and Albania in the years between the First and Second World Wars, alongside the continuities between those dictatorships and the communist regimes that followed. In contemporary examples, we examine Belarus and Russia alongside so-called hybrid regimes like Hungary. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
MUN198H1:Digital Technologies and Human Rights::24L:What are digital technologies, exactly? How do we govern them? Do they threaten or protect human rights? In this course, we’ll look at the Internet, advanced computing, ‘Big Data’ analytics, and artificial intelligence – the technologies which form the basis of everything from facial recognition software to home appliances to social media. We’ll consider how to govern and use these technologies, and the consequences of those choices for global human rights. Evaluation is based on essays, a presentation, and class participation.

NMC101H1:Land of the Pharaohs::24L/12T:Egypt is one of the oldest known civilizations on the African continent. Deeply embedded within early African history, Egypt was also inextricably linked with the history of many civilizations in the Ancient Near East. From pyramids to mummies and from King Tut to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the course will trace the history of ancient Egypt from its foundation around 3050 BCE to its incorporation into the Roman Empire in the 1st Century BCE. The focus will be on various aspects of Egyptian culture, including the institution of kingship, the role of women, and the characteristic features of Egyptian art, literature, and religion. Emphasis will be placed on the methods by which knowledge about this ancient civilization can be obtained.:::::Humanities:
NMC102H1:Heartland of Ancient Empires::24L/12T:Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East—the area of modern Iraq and adjacent regions—witnessed the rise of the first cities in the fourth millennium BC and the emergence of the world’s first empires in the first millennium BC. This course traces Mesopotamian history from the beginnings of agriculture through to the earliest cities, following the trajectory of political development from city states, to territorial states, and finally to the great empires of Assyria, Babylonia, and Achaemenid Persia and their aftermath. It studies the peoples and polities of the ancient Near East, including the Sumerians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. It also examines their cultural contributions, from the development of cuneiform writing to their achievements in law, administration, science, art and architecture, religion, and literature.:::::Humanities:
NMC103H1:The Islamic World::24L/12T:A broad introduction to Islam, including the history, culture, and religion of the people and places that came to be influenced by Islam and that constitute a world civilization. What makes something (an empire or state, or a work of art or music) Islamic? When and how did that which we think of today as Islamic come about? How has “the Islamic” changed over time? With these questions in mind, this course introduces students to major figures, events, themes, institutions, and intellectual currents in Islamic history, from its beginnings in the 7th century to the modern period. Key topics to be covered include the rise and spread of Islam, the Qur’an and the role of Arabic, political thought, law and society, and literary and artistic expressions. Attention is paid to the geographical and ethno-linguistic scope of the Muslim world, demonstrating the diversity of peoples and traditions that make up Islamic civilizations.:::::Humanities:
NMC104H1:The Biblical World::24L/12T:Examine the history, lands, peoples, religions, literatures and cultures that produced the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Topics to be covered include an overview of the geography and history of Ancient Israel and Judea, the role of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages, the literary genres reflected in biblical and some contemporary non-biblical texts, and the scholarly methods by which the Bible is studied.:::::Humanities:
NMC195H1:Rebels, Misfits, and Outcasts in Modern Arabic Literature::36S:This course examines modern Arabic literary texts that portray marginalized social figures and groups who have been excluded from a protective system of resources and privileges. Students will read novels and short stories by prominent Arab authors who have represented marginal social groups in their fiction, including representations of the urban poor, the peasantry, the delinquent, the prostitute, sexual minorities, women who reject normative roles, and the political rebel. These fictional texts address issues such as political resistance and rebellion, economic precarity, and social exclusion. Students will engage with these texts by critically examining the role of literature in narrating unspoken and suppressed histories. The class will also introduce students to theoretical modes of literary analysis and interpretation. All texts will be read in English translation. Authors include Mohamed Choukri, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alifa Rifaat, Sonallah Ibrahim, and Arwa Salih. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.::::NMC242H1:Humanities:
NMC196H1:Law and Order in the Ancient Near East::24S:Are human beings basically evil or good? What creates order in society? Coercion? Religion? Can societies operate without law? This course explores different systems of authority and control through ancient texts, focusing on the very first ideas of law in human history. We examine actual law codes, court cases on real estate disputes and conspiracy to commit murder and rape, as well as alternative means of regulating communities such as ideology, ritual and magic. While most courses on ancient law approach the topic from the perspective of modern concerns, this course situates the first law in its own historical, social and political context.

NMC197H1:Myth and History in the Bible::24S:Reading the Bible is easy, but reading it well isn’t. Should we read its stories as history? All of it? Or perhaps only part of it? If so, which parts? And if some parts aren’t meant to be read as history, then what are they? Was Jonah really swallowed by a large fish? Did the sun and moon stand still for Joshua? Did Moses really part the Red Sea? Did Jesus really raise Lazarus from the dead? Are miracles necessarily fiction? In this seminar, we will read together many of the most colourful stories of the Bible, sometimes alongside similar stories from the cultural context of ancient Israel, and discuss what genre (history, myth, legend, folktale) they belong to and how this affects our reading of these texts. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC198H1:Iranian Women Reveal Their Lives: The First Generation::24S:Persian women born in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century were products of a period of major social and cultural change. For the first time, an educated female could envision a life beyond the conservative ideal of a woman's proper place in the home. We will use memoirs of women who were able to contribute to Iranian society and interviews with women whose ambitions were inhibited or repressed by the dominance of patriarchal culture. Poems by women of this early generation vividly reveal both anger and hopes for the future. Memories of a Persian Childhood helps us to appreciate the important role of the family and childhood experience in the lives and ambitions of the first generation of Persian women to be unveiled and have access to a modern education. Both the Course Readings and Seminar Discussions are crucial to this course for exploring Persian women as individuals who grappled with the challenge of government initiatives and social conservatism.

NMC199H1:Babylon: Fact vs. Fiction::24S:The ancient city of Babylon, now a vast archaeological site in Iraq about 100km south of Baghdad, has captured people’s imagination up to this day. Who has not heard of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Biblical Tower of Babel, or the sci-fi TV series Babylon 5? Yet, how much of that reflects the reality of ancient Babylon? This course will explore the city of Babylon through its texts and archaeology and contrast this data with the way the city has been remembered over the past two thousand years. However, the goal of the course is not only to investigate how myths about Babylon have been constructed throughout the centuries. It will also look at the shortcomings of contemporary academic research on Babylon, and how difficult it is to reconstruct humankind's distant past. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC241H1:Anthropology of the Middle East::24L:This course aims to familiarize students with the anthropological study of the contemporary Middle East.

The course examines the aesthetic qualities of the novel as an artistic form as well as the ways it has represented and intervened in the modern social, political, and cultural upheavals that have shaped the Arabic-speaking world from the mid 19th century to the 21st century. Students will read literary criticism that addresses the Arabic novel’s emergence and consolidation as a major literary form and will engage with contemporary methods of literary analysis and interpretation. Topics addressed in the course include textual representations of colonialism and post-colonialism, gender and sexuality, representations of the peasantry, the nation-state and Arab nationalism, and discourses of progress and modernity. Authors include Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, Yahya Haqqi, Naguib Mahfouz, Tayeb Salih, Latifa al-Zayyat, Mohamad Choukri, and Hanan al-Shaykh. Readings of novels and criticism in English translation.:::::Humanities:
NMC244H1:The Arab Spring and Cultural Production::24L:This course examines the Arab revolutions that began in 2011 and their ongoing repercussions through the lens of cultural production. How have Arab writers and artists contributed to and reflected upon the Arab revolutions known as the Arab Spring? How has cultural production mediated the demands, aspirations, and struggles of the Arab peoples during and after these transformative revolutionary struggles? The cultural texts examined in this course range from those that mediate the euphoric optimism heralded by the revolutions to those that narrate and reflect upon the dystopian aftermath after revolutionary failure, including fiction and art that considers the reassertion of authoritarian rule, the violence of civil war, and the homelessness of exile. Through novels, poetry, music, art, and film, the course will broadly consider the role of culture as an alternative mode of narrating and historicizing the Arab revolutions.:3.0 credits at the 100-level::::Humanities:

NMC248H1:Ancient Bureaucracies::24L:Where were taxes first collected? When was the first receipt issued? What did the first account ledgers look like? This course offers an introduction to the development of early bureaucracies in ancient Mesopotamia (Iraq), Iran and Syria. Find out how accounting procedures evolved after 6,500 BC, from closing storage containers in Neolithic villages with seals and sealings to complex recording procedures in urban settings that ultimately led to the development of writing on clay tablets around 3,100 BC. Learn how different patterns of irrigation in river-based agricultural societies such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China led to similar yet distinct systems of resource management and administration, using different writing materials (e.g. clay tablets, papyrus) based on available raw materials. And see how bureaucratic procedures, while helping to maximize efficiency in an ancient society, could also create a lack of flexibility, ultimately leading to political decline or collapse.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC251H1:Voices from Ancient Egypt::24L:This course introduces students to the culture of ancient Egypt through the study of “functional” textual materials. After a brief introduction to the Ancient Egyptian language and writing system, we will read texts from domestic, religious (comprising funerary and ritual), historical, and scientific backgrounds to paint a rich picture of the daily life and experiences of the ancient Egyptians. By way of example, we will illustrate Egyptian funerary beliefs on the basis of texts found in tombs, such as autobiographies, offering formulae, and letters left there for the dead by their families; or the role of the pharaoh for the Egyptian state by studying monumental inscriptions left on temple walls, boundary stelae, and in the tombs of the Egyptian elite. No knowledge of Ancient Egyptian required; all texts read in translation.:::NMC101H1::Humanities:

NMC255H1:Love, Battle, and Wit: Classics of Premodern Arabic Literature::24L:This course surveys the premodern Arabic literary heritage, from pre-Islamic poetry to literature of the Mamluk period, focusing on texts that remained influential sometimes until the present day. Students read classic works in translation each week, while discussion focuses on social context and close reading. Throughout, we note the development of literary forms over time, and the way authors reference previous works. Readings include: the animal fable book Kalila wa Dimna, excerpts from anecdote collections (adab), multilingual Andalusi songs (muwashshah), the linguistically playful trickster tales called maqamat, an obscene shadow play by Ibn Daniyal, popular epic, and some of the most famous poems by Labid, Jarir, Abu Nuwas, Abu Tammam, al-Mutanabbi, and Ibn Nubata.:::1.0 credit in Humanities/BR=1 or 2::Humanities:
NMC256H1:1001 Nights Around the World::24L:The 1001 Nights has had many lives, in many languages, and across many media. This course starts off with a detailed reading, in translation, of one of the oldest surviving Arabic versions of the text, with consideration of its literary and social context, and its sources. We then move forward in time to examine how the 1001 Nights was expanded, adapted, and disseminated from then until today. A key transformation moment occurred between 1704-1717 with the publication of Antoine Galland’s French version, composed with the input of Syrian storyteller Hanna Diab. This version was widely disseminated and became a basis for most subsequent modern adaptations. We consider adaptations both before and after this turning point, including manuscripts, translations, novels, ballets, short stories, and films produced around the world. Throughout, we consider the politics and aesthetics of these historical translations, adaptations, and transformations.:::1.0 credit in Humanities/BR=1 or 2::Humanities:

NMC258H1:The Book of Kings: Persian Myth, History, and Art::24L:The Shahnameh, or Book of Kings, is the single most important book in Iranian national culture and one of the great epics of world literature. Composed in Persian by the poet Ferdowsi in the late 10th–early 11th centuries, it had a deep and lasting impact not only on Iran, but also on those cultures that came under the influence of Persian language, literature, and courtly traditions. The course examines, in English translation, the Shahnameh’s presentation of the history of the mythical dynasties of the ancient kings of Iran from the creation of the world to the Sasanians, the last historical dynasty to rule Iran before the Muslim Arab conquests. As the Shahnameh was frequently illustrated, attention will also be devoted to the manuscript tradition, which exhibits some of the finest examples of medieval Persian painting.:::::Humanities:
NMC259H1:Literature of Ancient and Late Antique Iran::24L:This course explores the most important texts of the Zoroastrian literature of ancient and late antique Iran and serves as a broad introduction to the mythical and ritual world of Zoroastrianism and the contours of pre-Islamic Iranian thought. The course is divided into two parts: a) Old Iranian literature, such as the Avestan religious literature and the Old Persian inscriptions, and b) Middle Persian (Pahlavi) literature, including epic poetry (Chronicle of Ardakhshir, narrating the deeds of the first Sasanian king), didactic and wisdom literature (Memorial of the Vizier Wuzurgmihr; Explanation of Chess and Backgammon), apocalyptic and visionary literature (Book of the Righteous Wiraz, describing his journey to heaven and hell), texts on cosmology (Primordial Creation), and encyclopaedic works (Acts of the Zoroastrian Religion), as well as specimens of Manichaean literature in Middle Iranian languages.

NMC260H1:Why the Ancient Near East? Investigating the Great Transformations in Pre- and Proto- History::48L:This is an experiential course that asks what it would have been like for people in the ancient Near East as their world underwent the profound changes wrought by domestication, farming, urbanism, and state formation. We focus on the sensory experiences of the body, and their effect upon the mind, by reconstructing and using spaces and objects that have come to define the archaeological periods from 10,000 to 2500 BCE. From circular communal buildings and the constraints and possibilities they offer, to replastering skulls and making hand-held figurines, to the performance of a ritual text, we link traditional teaching with walking a mile in ancient footwear. Participation in this course requires an active imagination and a willingness to get physical.:::::Humanities:

This course provides a comprehensive survey of the origins and rise of political leadership in the Near East from its beginnings in the Neolithic period to the famous kings and military leaders of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylon. Sources consulted include archaeological data (architecture, monuments, narrative art) as well as historical sources. The course is intended as an introduction to a broader understanding of the mechanisms that result in the formation of political power structures. Although it focuses on the ancient Near East, the course will discuss parallels from other parts of the world, both ancient and modern, that are relevant to understanding manifestations of political power in our present-day world.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC267H1:Everyday Life in Ancient Egypt::24L/12T:The course focuses on lived experience for people from many different socio-economic levels in ancient Egypt. Through the analysis of archaeological and mortuary evidence, artifacts, and human, animal, and plant remains we will explore the daily lives of Egyptians over time as the natural, social and technological landscape changed, posing questions such as what they ate, how they made things, what kinds of social connections they formed, how they defined their identities, what kind of houses and village, town, or urban settings they lived in, what things they feared, how they died, and what they might have believed. We will look at remains from settlements like Hierakonpolis, Abydos, Giza, Kahun, Tell el-Dab'a, Amarna, Deir el-Medina, and Thebes in detail to understand aspects of the lives of the people who inhabited them.:::NMC101H1:NMC362Y1:Humanities:

We begin with the origins of the piety movement in early Islam, and the ways in which it responded to late antique Christian monasticism. We then examine the emergence of classical Sufism in the 9th century, its basic concepts and practices, the rise of saints, the formation of Sufi orders, the social and cultural context for key developments, as well as the reasons for the contested legacy of Sufism in the modern world. Major figures for discussion include Rabi'a, Junayd, Hallaj, Ghazali, Ibn Arabi, and Rumi.:::::Humanities:
NMC274H1:The Turks in History: From Nomads of the Steppe Frontier to Islamic Rulers::24L:The course examines the roles of Turks and other primarily nomadic peoples as raiders, migrants, slave-soldiers, and empire-builders in the ancient and medieval history of Eurasia (including Central Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe) and in the formation of the Islamic world. Topics covered include long-distance economic and cultural contacts (“silk roads”) facilitated by “steppe empires”; the Islamization of the Turks and their gradual takeover of Iranian, Arab, and other Muslim lands; lifeways (especially pastoral nomadism); the relationship between nomadic and sedentary societies; political structures; steppe warfare; the role of physical geography and the environment. Students explore the histories and landscape geographies of Turks through fascinating primary sources and internet resources.

NMC275H1:The Mongol Empire and the World It Made::24L:Most of Eurasia (the Middle East, East and South Asia, Eastern Europe) was once incorporated into the Mongol Empire and greatly influenced by Mongol rule. It may be said that the beginnings of modern history on the Eurasian continent were shaped by the impact of the Mongols and their non-Mongol (mainly Turkic) partners. This course explores the history of the pan-Eurasian empire founded by Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) in the 13th century and the smaller empires into which it devolved: Yuan China-Mongolia, Chaghatayid Mongolia-Central Asia, Ilkhanid Iran-Anatolia, and the Golden Horde Eastern Europe-Western Siberia. The course also surveys various post-Mongol successor states, such as the Timurid and Mughal Empires, and the Kazakh, Uzbek, and Crimean Tatar Khanates, as well as touches upon important non-Chinggisid successor polities, such as Muscovy-Russia and Slavic Cossacks.

Starting with the situation on the eve of the Crusades, we trace broader patterns in Islamic history through the emergence of various sultanates (including the dynasty of Salah al-Din Ayyubi and the Mamluks) as well as regional dynamics from North Africa and Spain in the West to Iran and India in the East.:::NMC103H1:NMC273Y1:Humanities:
NMC284H1:Judaism and Feminism: Legal Issues from Menstruation to Ordination::24L:Agitation for change exists in religious practice worldwide in areas of access, status, inclusion, and egalitarianism. Traditional religion is often in conflict with egalitarian modernity. This sometimes results in difficulties with religious identification. This course will explore the interaction between feminism and Judaism. We will examine how Jewish law (halakhah) sometimes conflicts with ideas of egalitarianism particularly in legal disabilities for women such as divorce, lack of access to high-level Torah study, and discrimination in public religious roles. The traditional exemption of women from the obligation of Torah study had great impact on women’s religious responsibility and status. Various movements within Judaism competed in efforts to resolve these difficulties. In this course we will consider to what extent inclusion and egalitarianism have become complementary to traditional Judaism.:::::Humanities:

NMC316H1:Cultural Encounter in Arabic Narrative::36S:This course examines historical and literary texts that narrate Muslim and Arab encounters with cultural difference. Students will read travel narratives, autobiographies, and fictional texts that chronicle encounters with the Arab-Islamic world’s cultural “others.” The course first examines travel narratives from the medieval Islamic period, including al-Sirafi’s travels to India and China, and Ibn Fadlan’s encounters with peoples inhabiting lands north of the Abbasid Empire, such as the Vikings. Students then consider how travel narratives in the modern period are transformed due to radical changes in the balance of power between Europe and the Middle East, first reading 19th-century travel narratives to Paris (al-Tahtawi), and then focusing on 20th-century texts that narrate the travels of Arab men and women to Europe and North America (Leila Ahmed, Sayyid Qutb, Nawal El Saadawi). Students will also read texts that depict encounters with non-Arabs within the modern Arab world, such as literary depictions of American oil workers in the Arab Gulf (Munif).

NMC330H1:King David: Musician, Monarch, or Murderer?::24L:For many people, King David is one of the most beloved characters in the Bible. But where did our ideas about David come from? Was he a brilliant poet who wrote many of the Psalms, a youthful champion who defeated the giant Goliath or as a ruthless monarch capable of killing his political opponents? This course will explore attempts to reconstruct the historical David from various biblical texts, comparable ancient literature, and what historians know (and don’t know) about the time in which his story is set. All readings will be in English. No knowledge of Hebrew is required.:4.0 credits at the 200-level::::Humanities:
NMC331H1:Samson: Lover, Liar, lion-slayer::24L:Over the centuries, Samson has captured the imagination of countless scholars, artists, and poets. Although often stereotyped as little more than a thoughtless strong man prone to violent outbursts, he is actually one of the most complex and enigmatic characters in the Bible. This course will explore biblical depictions of this often misunderstood figure and his complicated relationships with his family, his lovers, and his enemies. We will analyze his story within its ancient historical context and in some more recent interpretations. All readings will be in English.

NMC340H1:History of Late Antique & Early Islamic Iran::24L:The political, religious, and cultural history of greater Iran from Late Antiquity to the Mongol invasions in the early 13th century. The course surveys the reigns of the kings of the Sasanian empire (3rd–7th centuries); traces the progress of the Muslim Arab conquests in the mid-7th century that resulted in the Persian empire’s collapse and the gradual Islamization of its population; and examines the subsequent formation of regional Iranian dynasties that were instrumental in the creation of a new Perso-Islamic cultural identity.:::NMC280H1:NMC348Y1:Humanities:
NMC341H1:Safavid Iran: Reign of the Shahs::24L:The course focuses on the period of the Safavid dynasty (16th–18th centuries) which represented a watershed in the history of Iran not only because of its adoption and promotion of Shi‘ism as the state religion, but also on account of its fostering an imperial court culture that patronized the arts and architecture. The reigns of the Safavid shahs will be examined from the point of view of their political, religious, economic, and cultural history, as well as their relationship to the polities that immediately preceded them and their interactions with the contemporary Muslim states they neighboured, in particular, the Ottomans in the west and the Mughals in the east.:::NMC274H1,  NMC340H1:NMC348Y1:Humanities:

Among the key concepts analyzed will be history, time, language, and selfhood. Students will experiment with appropriately using concepts from modern critical theory in the analysis of premodern and modern Arabic literary texts. Readings include Qur’anic apocalyptic suras, the philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqzan, Sindbad the Sailor and other travel narratives, al-Maʿarri’s satirical narrative of a visit to the afterlife, trickster tales of the maqama genre. We then turn to the merging of novelistic forms, selfhoods, and conceptions of political organization with those of the maqama in early novels by al-Muwaylihi and al-Shidyaq, ending with contemporary conceptual art and a dystopic novel.:4.0 credits in Humanities/BR= 1 or 2::::Humanities:

NMC356H1:Anthropology of Islam::24L:This course introduces students to studies of contemporary Islam that are based on extensive periods of research with Muslim communities in their own languages using anthropological methods. What do such studies teach us about the varied ways Muslims engage with their religious tradition in the modern world? And how can such studies make us think differently about gender, economy, science, and secularism? We will discuss examples from Nigeria to Somalia, Egypt, Turkey, and Iran, to India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, to Canada, the US, and Europe. Students will apply anthropological methods learned in class to do research among a Muslim community in Toronto or online.:::NMC103H1/ RLG204H1/ NMC241H1/ ANT207H1:RLG355H1:Humanities, Social Science:

Class discussion considers debates in the field about how to analyze these texts in their historical context and in a theoretically grounded manner. Topics addressed include: popular and elite narrative representations of gender and sexuality; pre-Islamic and Abbasid poetry and remarks composed by women, and their transmission in male-authored anthologies; hetero- and homoerotic obscenity and eroticism in Arabic poetry, epistles, and scientific texts; and literary representations of sexual minorities like eunuchs, intersex people, and mukhannathūn (people with apparently male biology who dressed and behaved as women, and had a specific social position at certain times).:::4.0 credits in Humanities::Humanities:
NMC358H1:Gender and Sexuality in Modern Middle Eastern Cultures::24L:This course examines questions of gender and sexuality in the broader Middle East (Iran, Turkey, and the Arab world) from the colonial period (19th to early 20th centuries) to the present through readings of religious, cultural, historical, visual, and literary texts. We will begin the course by thinking critically about colonial and Orientalist legacies that continue to structure contemporary debates on representations of women, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East and North Africa. Students will read and analyze a range of primary historical texts written by Middle Eastern women reflecting the ways in which women of different backgrounds (religious, class, urban/rural) and generations have conceptualized and inhabited their gendered and sexual identities. Topics students will explore include the development of modern secular and religious feminist thought; cultural representations of gender, sexuality, and queerness; fictional texts that represent non-normative expressions of gender and sexuality; and critical approaches to theorizing gender and sexuality in the Middle East.

NMC365H1:Women and Gender in Egyptian Archaeology::36S:The course explores issues related to gender within the ancient Egyptian context and investigates the activities of women through the study of many different kinds of archaeological and material evidence. We'll build a foundation for this work with an overview of current developments in gender theory and consider their applications for research on ancient Egyptian society and culture. No prior knowledge of theoretical approaches is expected. From this basis, we'll go on to consider how archaeological material can contribute to the understanding of gender roles and examine how excavators may unconsciously impose their own gender perspectives on ancient contexts, creating biased views of ancient societies that become entrenched in scholarly tradition. The same methods of critical analysis will inform our study of women in ancient Egypt, incorporating archaeological data and artifactual material that can inform our understanding of the complex roles that women played in Egyptian culture, society, and religious practice.:3.0 credits in BR=1/2/3::NMC101H1 or ( NMC343H1/ NMC344H1) or  NMC251H1::Humanities:

Following an overview of the Safavid revolution and the empire it created (1501–1722), we examine the political upheavals experienced in post-Safavid Iran throughout the 18th century that culminated in the rise of the Qajar polity. This review of early modern Iranian history will set the stage for our investigation of the defining moments in the modern history of Iran, including the Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911), the subsequent toppling of the Qajar dynasty, and the establishment of Pahlavi rule under Reza Shah. We then focus on the events leading up to and including the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the making of the Islamic Republic. The course concludes with an exploration of society and culture in contemporary Iran.:::NMC348Y1::Humanities:
NMC375H1:Conversion to Islam in Medieval History::24S:How did Islam spread in the world? The question has puzzled historians for years. For centuries after the rise of Islam, much of the Middle East was still largely comprised of diverse communities of non-Muslims. This course on the complex history of “Islamization” examines when, how, and why various societies became majority Muslim, through a close look at case studies and sources from across the medieval world including Spain, North Africa, Central Asia and India. Topics covered include religious tolerance, polemic, cultural assimilation, minority identities, interreligious marriages, children of mixed families, and the contentious issues of apostasy and forced conversion.:NMC103H1 or  NMC273Y1::::Humanities:

This course approaches this question through critical reading in the histories of capitalism, crisis, science, politics, and intersections between cultural history and technology studies using the Middle East as a starting point for the study of global phenomena. We will examine the ways in which constructions like race and ethnicity, gender, and the human/non-human divide have mediated the social and spatial expansion of capital in the region, especially through technological infrastructure and utopias between the late 18th and the 21st centuries.:0.5 credit in NMC/HIS/HPS at the 200+ level.

NMC395H1:Iconography of the Art and Material Culture of the Islamic World::24S:The art and material culture of the Islamic world is rich in iconography - from Persian paintings to Afghan war rugs - with complex layers of meaning that are not necessarily understood at first glance. Such imagery can be comprehended through numerous lenses, from pre-Islamic concepts and literary themes to politically-driven motivations or religious beliefs and practices. Through a series of case studies of examples of painting, ceramics, metalwork, textiles, and contemporary art, the course examines the meanings behind the iconography on objects from across the Middle East and Central Asia, dating from the medieval period to the present day.:::::Humanities:
NMC396H1:The Art of the Qur’an::24L:The holy Qur’an, believed by Muslims to be the Word of God, has been a source of creative and artistic inspiration for Muslims around the world and through the ages.

PHL198H1:Philosophy of Time::24S:The passage of time is a fundamental aspect of human experience: we are born, we grow older, and eventually we pass away. During our lives our experience of the past, present, and future are distinct. We can influence the world in the present and the future, but it does not seem that we can influence the past. We have hopes about the future, memories of the past, and experiences of the present. In this seminar we will explore insights from contemporary philosophy and physics concerning the nature of the passage of time. Questions to be considered may include the following: What does it mean to say that time passes? Does time really pass at all? How do we experience time?
