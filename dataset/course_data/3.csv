PHY196H1:Emergence in Nature::24S:The universe is not a rigid clockwork, but neither is it formless and random. Instead, it is filled with highly organized, evolved structures that have somehow emerged from simple rules of physics. Examples range from the structure of galaxies to the pattern of ripples on windblown sand, to biological and even social processes. These phenomena exist in spite of the universal tendency towards disorder. How is this possible? Self-organization challenges the usual reductionistic scientific method, and begs the question of whether we can ever really understand or predict truly complex systems.

PHY199H1:Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the New Black::24S:It is now 90 years since astronomers found the first evidence for a form of matter that wasn't part of the stars in our galaxies, but rather is "dark" and has a gravitational attraction to ordinary matter. Other lines of evidence lead us to believe that there is six times more dark matter than the ordinary matter we are familiar with. Despite this, we have no credible, direct evidence for what this dark matter might be. It is one of the biggest puzzles in particle physics and cosmology. In the last decade, we have also discovered that something else is going on – the universe appears to be filled with "dark energy" that causes the expansion of our universe to speed up instead of slowdown. We will discuss what we know about the hypotheses of dark matter and dark energy, and the debates about what might really be going on. Are we seeing science in crisis, with a revolution just around the corner, or is this just the "normal science" talked about by Kuhn and other philosophers of science? Participants will be expected to participate in seminar-style discussions, as well as take the lead on at least one topic of discussion. Restricted to first-year students.

RLG101H1:Reason and Religion in the Modern Age::24L:An introduction to critical thinking about religion as it took shape in modern European thought. We examine major thinkers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hannah Arendt, and others. Issues covered include freedom of thought, the relationship between religion and politics, belief and truth, rational ethics in relation to religious ethics. We explore how issues addressed by these classical authors remain relevant in today's world.:::::Humanities:
RLG102H1:Blood, Sex and Drugs::24L/12T:Religion can be understood as a set of aspirations that manages and moralizes the most intimate matters of social life, including sexual intercourse, bodily fluids, and mind altering substances. This course engages fundamental theories of religion to consider an eclectic set of case studies that troubles a clean divide between purity and danger.::::RLG101H1 (Introducing Religion: Blood, Sex and Drugs), offered in Winter 2019 and Winter 2020:Humanities:
RLG103H1:Sports and/as Religion::24L/12T:A first-year course looking at the historical and contemporary relationship between religion and sport. We start with the Ancient Greek Olympics (a funeral ritual) and end with the ever-hopeful gathering of Toronto Maple Leafs fans, Leaf Nation. In between, we look at examples of those sports around the world, in which religion plays a significant role or where sports serves as a religion-like pastime.:::::Humanities:
RLG104H1:Conspiracies, Social Media, and the Rise of New Religious Movements::24L/12T:Conspiracy theories are nothing new, but in the past few years we have all witnessed the meteoric rise of conspiracies such as QAnon via social media, which have taken on the elements of New Religious Movements. This course examines recent examples of new religious movements that might be thought of as “conspiritualities,” that is, conspiracies with strong cult and religious overtones.:::::Humanities:
RLG105H1:Spirituality, Religion, and the Environment::24L/12T:Humans, in diverse cultures and throughout history, have felt a deep connection to their environments. This search for a feeling of connection and oneness has led humans into canyons and caves, up mountains and rock faces, and across deserts and oceans. Sometimes this nature spirituality occurs within religious traditions, sometimes outside of them, and sometimes even in opposition to ‘religion.’ This course will explore the phenomenon of nature spirituality, and the wonder often associated with it. Readings will engage mystics and mountaineers, poets and painters, and farmers and foresters, all exploring nature connection in the context of the environmental crisis.::::RLG239H1 (Spirituality and Nature) taken in Winter 2023:Humanities:
RLG106H1:Happiness::24L:Are you happy? Today happiness is a metric by which a growing number of people assess the quality of their lives, with a range of experts offering innumerable life hacks and opportunities to optimize life. But what does it mean to be happy? And how have people tried to achieve this ever-elusive state? Situated squarely within the study of religion, this course considers how different traditions from around the world and for thousands of years have raised similar questions about happiness—not simply for the sake of reflection but also to do something about it. And their answers have varied: fast, meditate, pray, go to the desert, come together, get high, suffer, renounce God, and/or make lots of money. Readings will include selections from social theory and religious texts as well as a few authors who seem to be (against all odds) kind of happy.:::::Humanities:
RLG107H1:"It's the End of the World as We Know It"::24L/12T:Throughout history, many religious movements have envisioned the end of the world. This course will explore the ways in which different religious movements have prepared for and expected an end time, from fears, symbols, and rituals to failed prophecies and social violence. By examining traditions such as Jewish and Christian apocalyptic texts through to fears of nuclear apocalypse and zombies, the course seeks to understand the ways in which ancient and modern claims of “the end” reflect the aspirations, anxieties, and religious concerns of communities.:::::Humanities:
RLG108H1:The Question of God::24L/12T:What is God? Who is God? Is Yahweh the same as the Christian God? What about Allah? How do people come to see, hear, or feel God? Belief in God is a core tenet of all monotheistic religions, yet the figure of God is elusive and contested. This course offers an introduction to the study of religion and to how the discipline has engaged with the figure of God. Issues covered include histories of God (including proclamations of the “death of God”); psychological and anthropological views on prayer, divine interventions, and God-human relations; God and empire/colonialism; feminist (and other subversive) re-imaginings of God; and atheism. Regardless of their own belief, students will learn to grapple with an inescapable figure, will learn about lived Islam and Christianity (and to a lesser extent Judaism), and will gain insights into a range of thinking tools offered by the study of religion.::::RLG239H1 (Special Topics: The Question of God), offered in Fall 2021:Humanities:
RLG195H1:Alt-Bible: What Could Have Been::24S:Why does our contemporary Bible not include any daughters for Adam and Eve or any stories of Jesus as a young boy? What if Enoch was more prominent than Moses or Thomas more prominent than Paul? "The Bible" that we have is not a single book or a simple collection, but something that has grown over time, been the object of contention and argument, and has sometimes been a common ground across traditions. We examine side-by-side writings that have become canonical and writings that once held authority but have not found widespread canonical status, and strive to understand the processes by which we ended up with "the Bible" we have today. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/CNR option.:::::Humanities:
RLG196H1:Goddess Lessons: Gender, Religion and Pop::24S:Is God a woman? How can we get to heaven without losing a piece of ourselves? What does it mean to follow Lesbian Jesus? Pop music provides us with some important – if often surprising – opportunities to think through deep questions. Increasingly, these questions tie together two of our most powerful human categories: gender and religion. This course will consider the diverse interactions between pop, gender, and religion. Examples might include Beyonce’s self-representation as the Yoruba goddess Oshun and Lil Nas X’s reinterpretation of the Garden of Eden in Montero. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
RLG197H1:Enchantment, Disenchantment, Re-Enchantment::24L:Modernity is associated with disenchantment, secularisation and progress, and has traditionally been understood as the successor to the enchanted, spiritual, and transcendent worldviews of antiquity and the middle ages. Re-enchantment, a term increasingly encountered in popular and academic contexts alike, demonstrates nostalgia for an enchanted past, a discomfort with the modern narrative, and a desire to recover wonder. This course will examine the history of enchantment through a series of readings taken from literature, philosophy, theology, ranging from Plato to contemporary magical realism. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
RLG198H1:Dystopia: Religion & Gender in Science Fiction::24L:This course will examine the “what ifs” and imagined worlds of ideal utopias and oppressive dystopias through the lens of religion and gender in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale and Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland. Because science fiction and utopian/dystopian literature expresses what an author sees as possible or hopes is possible, but also fears is possible, we will consider science fiction as a political and social critique. Themes to be covered include fundamentalism, totalitarianism, the relationship between technology and religion, religion and reproductive rights, and the potential relationship between religion, gender and oppression. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
RLG199H1:Contagions::24S:It is obvious that infections spread through social networks; what is less well known is that forms of human behaviour, including religious affiliation, have network characteristics. This course examines a variety of historical and contemporary contagions to introduce essential concepts in network analysis and the factors that account for the spread of innovation and other forms of human behaviour. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
RLG200H1:The Study of Religion::24L/12T:An introduction to the discipline of the study of religion. This course surveys methods in the study of religion and the history of the discipline in order to prepare students to be majors or specialists in the study of religion.:::::Humanities:
RLG201H1:Indigenous Spiritualities and Religions::24L/12T:This course examines how Indigenous communities saw the world before contact—primarily exploring early creation narratives and ways of engaging with the natural world through ceremonials of reciprocity and acknowledgements. It engages with how early colonial societies and Western-based religions evaluated and understood Indigenous spiritualities and practices. We consider Indigenous critiques of Western religion as it has actually been practiced as opposed to what has been taught as constituting the ideals of civilization. Finally, we analyze how Indigenous communities and culture begin to create “New Religions” that blend Indigenous values and thinking with aspects of Western culture or emerge in direct response to re-imagining spirituality in attempts to prove humanness and civility in contexts where little of Indigenous culture and values has been seen as acceptable.:::::Humanities:
RLG202H1:Judaism::24L/12T:An introduction to the religious tradition of the Jews that explores key themes as they change from ancient times to today. The set of themes will include: the Sabbath, Study, Place, Household, Power. Each year will focus on one theme. We will read holy texts, modern literature, history, ethnography, and philosophy, covering each theme in a range of genres and across the diverse span of Jewish experience.:::RLG100Y1/ RLG200H1/ RLG280Y1:RLG202H5,  RLG202Y1:Humanities:
RLG203H1:Christianity::24L/12T:We explore the multiple religious traditions of Christianity and follow key themes as they have changed throughout the last two millennia. The themes might include: the Bible and its translation; missionizing and colonial practices; belief and conversion; authority and power; capitalism and Christianity. The course will equip students to understand how and why Christianity has come to exert such influence around the globe. No familiarity with the Bible, Christianity, or the academic study of religion is assumed.:::RLG100H1/  RLG200H1/  RLG280Y1:RLG203H5,  RLG203Y1:Humanities:
RLG204H1:Islam::24L/24T:An introduction to the Islamic religious tradition that explores its diversity and development, from its inception to the modern period. Themes include Pre-Islamic Arabia, the life of Muhammad and the Qur’an, the development of the notion of Sunna and Hadith, Islamic religious communities (Sunni, Shiite and Ismaili traditions), Sufism, and religious practices. The course will emphasize the complexity of the Islamic tradition both in its classical phase and in modernity including Islam in the diaspora.:::RLG200H1:RLG204H5,  RLG204Y1:Humanities:
RLG205H1:Hinduism::24L/24T:This course explores themes relating to the religion of Hindus, called Hinduism since modernity. Topics include the canonical literatures, philosophies, and doctrines of Hinduism, along with the debates surrounding them; lived Hinduism, and the texts that inform its practice and experience; activities considered quintessential to Hinduism, such as temple visits, yoga, and venerating a guru; and the vibrant spectrum of Hindu expression one encounters in the diaspora. The course will equip students with fluency in core concepts and practices of Hinduism, as well as an understanding of Hindu history as one of dynamism and transformation.:::RLG100Y1/  RLG200H1/  RLG280Y1:RLG205H5,  RLG205Y1:Humanities:
RLG206H1:Buddhism::24L/24T:This course traces the socio-historical development of Buddhist traditions across the diverse regions of South, Southeast, Central, and East Asia from their foundations in early India to their transmission in the contemporary West. Although much of our time will be spent reading, grappling with, and discussing Buddhist literary works (premodern, modern), we will also consider the institutional and practical dimensions of Buddhism as a lived tradition. To that end, weekly readings and lectures will be supplemented with maps, images, and videos to highlight the vast geographical range and significance of Buddhist traditions over time, as well as their rich visual and material cultures. By the end of the course students are expected to have a solid understanding of the basic timeline of Buddhist history in Asia, together with the major figures, key concepts, central texts, and ritual practices comprising Buddhist traditions.:::RLG200H1:RLG206H5,  RLG206Y1:Humanities:

RLG209H1:Justifying Religious Belief::24L:Beliefs typically characterized as “religious” concern such things as the existence and nature of the deity, the afterlife, the soul, miracles, and the universe’s meaningfulness, ultimate purpose, or interest in the distribution and realization of justice. Common to these and other religious beliefs is that they lack empirical evidence to support them – at least so say religious skeptics. They insist that rational beliefs require justification and that justification comes from perceptions anyone could have or solid scientific reasoning. Anyone who harbors religious beliefs thus violates a basic epistemic responsibility. How might people who hold – and want to continue to hold – religious beliefs respond to these accusations and doubts?  The course examines these basic epistemological and moral challenges to religious belief as well as the various strategies available to religious believers who are confronted with such demands for justifications. By doing so, we will aim to understand better whether religious beliefs of various sorts could count as rational, whether reasonable people might disagree with each other about the very nature of reality and morality, and whether anyone who falls short of common intellectual and social ideals of rationality and reasonableness ought to be tolerated.:::::Humanities:
RLG211H1:Psychology of Religion::24L/12T:The psychoanalytic study of religion examines the nature of religious beliefs, experiences and practices as creations of mind and culture. What is the nature of and relationship between belief and knowledge, subjective and objective experience/reality, phantasy, dreams and reality? How do the individual and social unconscious create and shape religious beliefs, experiences and practices? These and other questions are explored in order to understand the ways in which psychoanalysis, as a critical theory of religion, contributes to theorizing the ways in which individual psychology is also social psychology. Included in our focus is a consideration of mystical, visionary, esoteric and paranormal experiences in the psychoanalytic study of religion. Insights from evolutionary and cognitive psychology and neuroscience will be considered as well in our discussions of psychology and religion.:::::Social Science:
RLG212H1:Anthropology, Religion and Culture::24L/24T:Is religion a matter of belief or a matter of practice? Do all religions share common features? Is one born into religion, or does one learn to be religious? This course is designed to introduce students to some of the ways in which anthropologists have studied and thought about religion. The emphasis is not on memorizing things people believe and do in different societies but on understanding how anthropologists have tried to explain religious phenomena. The themes covered in the course include: magic and religion; the (ir)rationality of belief; the body as a site of knowledge; ritual; ethical self-cultivation; and religion’s role in the secular age.::::RLG212Y1:Social Science:
RLG213H1:Embarrassment of Scriptures::24L/12T:Surveys interpretative traditions related to sacred texts, focusing on reading strategies that range from the literal to the figurative with attention to rationales that transform literal textual meanings and copyists manipulations of texts. May focus on various religious traditions from year to year, targeting a single canonical tradition or comparative analysis. Students will gain insight into literalist, environmentalist, secularist and erotic approaches to texts. Prior exposure to the study of religion is not required; all readings will be in English.:::::Humanities:
RLG214H1:Mythologies and Religion::24L:Myths and legends are narrative means for humans to make sense of their environment, the organization of their societies, and their social practices. This course introduces the principal myths and mythological figures of a selection of mythic systems (Near Eastern, Celtic, Nordic, Slavic and Indigenous North American) as way of modelling the world. Such topics as creation, chaos and order, love and death, coming of age, the monstrous, and explanations of evil and misfortune, and the survival and the transformation of mythic and folkloric elements.:::::Humanities:
RLG215H1:New Religious Movements::24L/12T:The saying goes that "Cult + Time = Religion." In this course, we will examine this assertion, looking especially at the development of recent religions, such as Scientology. This course will probe the history of scholarship on new religious movements (once known as "cult studies") and explore the challenges inherent in studying controversial movements.:::::Humanities:
RLG217H1:Black Diaspora Religions::24L/12T:This course critically examines the intersection of religion and cultural expressions in the African Diaspora, with a particular emphasis on the Canadian landscape. The importance of religion in the Black Diaspora's experience of both oppression and liberation will be a key component of our analytic framework in explaining and understanding the Black/African experience and culture in the diaspora.:::::Humanities:
RLG218H1:Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Religion::24L/12T:In modern history, sacred and sacramental understandings of nature have often been marginalised and criticized as primitive and superstitious. Today, these beliefs and practices increasingly present themselves as sources of overlooked ecological knowledge, and resources in our search for a sustainable human-nature relationship. This course focuses upon efforts to recover, reclaim and relegitimise alternative understandings of nature and traditional ecologies in the context of the contemporary environmental crisis. Students will deploy course readings as resources for considering a particular contemporary environmental challenge through field work culminating in a creative environmental project.:::::Humanities:
RLG222H1:Witchcraft, Religion and the Powers of the Occult::24L:Picture a witch in your mind’s eye. Do you see them as male, female, or somewhere between the two? Young or old? Good or evil? This course goes beyond common Western assumptions about the character and morality of witchcraft to show how its study, its representation and its practice contribute in vital ways to our understandings of religion, the occult, morality, gender, sexuality and science. We move across Europe, Africa, Melanesia and North America to shed light on a controversial figure in numerous societies and literary traditions, past and present. Depictions of witches, wiccans, sorcerers and magicians are analyzed and compared. At the same time, the course should make you ask yourself: What is rational, what is ethical—and ultimately, what is human?::::RLG337H1:Humanities:
RLG230H1:Religion, Law and Society::24L/12T:The course examines various issues, including: Canadian society and secularization; religious pluralism and legal pluralism; the role of religions in public contexts; land and property; marriage and women’s rights; and the place of minority religious communities.:::::Humanities:
RLG231H1:Music and Religion: From Bach to Kanye West::24L/12S:What is music to religion? This course is an exploration of religion and music from a global perspective. ‘World’ music will be placed in comparative frameworks with various ‘world’ religions in order to understand how music has been and continue to be at the core of religious narratives, rituals, beliefs, and cultural performances.:::::Humanities:
RLG232H1:Religion and Film::24L:The role of film as a mediator of thought and experience concerning religious worldviews. The ways in which movies relate to humanity's quest to understand itself and its place in the universe are considered in this regard, along with the challenge which modernity presents to this task. Of central concern is the capacity of film to address religious issues through visual symbolic forms.:4.0 credits:::RLG390H1:Humanities:
RLG233H1:Religion and Popular Culture::36L:A course on the interactions, both positive and negative, between religion and popular culture. We look at different media (television, advertising, print) as they represent and engage with different religious traditions, identities, and controversies.:::::Humanities:
RLG234H1:Language and Religion::24L/12S:What is language to religion? And how is it used by humans and divine agents? This course moves across traditions, examining types of communications from speech to rhetoric to book to revelation; and types of communicators from hermit to evangelist to deity. We will see language used to clarify and to obscure; to exclude and to liberate. And we will think about miscommunication too: the message lost in transmission. All readings will be in English. No knowledge of other languages is required.:::::Humanities:
RLG235H1:Religion, Gender, and Sexuality::24L:This course equips students to understand how norms and practices of gender and sexuality are deeply entangled with religious imaginations and traditions. We will examine how ritual, scriptural, and legal traditions enable and constrain embodied and political power. Readings will draw from feminist, womanist, queer, and other perspectives. With a combination of in-class discussions, critical reading exercises, and short essay assignments, students will strengthen their awareness of transnational intersections of religion, gender, and "religio-racial" formations. You will develop skills in analyzing the role of popular culture and legal and religious texts in shaping norms and experiences of gender and embodiment.:Completion of 4.0 credits.:::RLG314H5:Social Science:
RLG236H1:Material Religion::24L:Religions are more than beliefs or sacred texts. They are also formed through buildings, bodies, objects of devotion, images, websites. We examine how religion is embodied, circulated, built, played, displayed, and painted. We ask why religions are often constituted through feasting or fasting, excess or asceticism, abundance of objects or destruction of icons. Religious activity is explored through its connections with objects of wealth and consumption--not just great art, but items common within popular culture. The overall aim is to ‘see’ religion in a new way—and to understand the role of the senses in the formation of religious experience.:::::Humanities:

Particular attention will focus on the unconscious and its role in the transgenerational transmission of trauma, especially through myths and religions. Freud’s theory of dreams are compared with Jung’s ideas of universal symbols and archetypes, including the personal and collective unconscious. Jung's theory of synchronicity will be discussed alongside Freud's theory of telepathy or thought-transference, including their implications for different understandings of the unconscious and archaic inheritance expressed and manifested in religions and religious experience.:Completion of 4.0 credits::::Social Science:
RLG302H1:Dreams, Visions and the Invisible::24L:In many cultures, dreaming is understood to open pathways to unseen realities and worlds populated by spirit beings, souls of the dead, noetic powers and avenues to mystical union. Dreams include visions, daydreams, and dissociative, altered states of consciousness. This course examines contributions from a variety of disciplines such as psychoanalytic psychology, anthropology, biblical criticism, neuroscience, and paleo-archaeology to the study of religious experiences. Topics include how human beings negotiate the contents of their minds that result in social and political agreements that distinguish what is deemed as real, thereby constituting acceptable religious experience. The course will also discuss crisis apparitions, alien abduction accounts, spirit possession and existence of life after death as culturally specific religious narratives that seek to articulate and organize dreams and other visionary experiences.:Completion of 4.0 credits:::RLG249H1:Humanities:
RLG303H1:Evil and Suffering::24L:The existence of evil poses a problem to theistic beliefs and raises the question as to whether a belief in a deity is incompatible with the existence of evil and human (or other) suffering.

RLG318H1:Sacred & Secular Nature in the Christian West::24L:How did we get to where we are now? How did humans come to be so alienated from nature? This course will examine how religion, particularly that of the Christian West, has shaped the understanding of, and interaction with, nature on a global level. It examines the complex shift from understanding nature as sacred and revelatory, to its conceptualization as a commodity and resource. Students will explore the ethical and cultural consequences of this shift for the human-nature relationship, and contemporary attempts to recover a notion of sacred nature in the context of the environmental crisis.:Completion of 4.0 credits::::Humanities:

All readings will be in English. No knowledge of Hebrew is required.:Completion of 4.0 credits::NMC252H1::Humanities:
RLG322H1:Early Gospels::24L:Careful examination of the earliest “lives of Jesus” (‘gospels’) shows that they offer very different portraits of Jesus of Nazareth. The course will compare ancient biographical accounts of famous ancient figures such as Alexander the Great, the Caesars, and wandering philosophers with early depictions of Jesus, both the gospels that eventually were included in the New Testament, and extra-canonical or “apocryphal” gospels such as the Gospels of Thomas, Peter, or Mary.:Completion of 4.0 credits::RLG241H1/ RLG241Y1::Humanities:

RLG325H1:The Uses and Abuses of the Bible::24L:From politics to popular culture, the Bible has shaped people and nations for good and for ill. This course introduces the Jewish and Christian Bibles and considers case studies of how biblical texts have been interpreted. The Bible has been used to bolster slavery and white supremacy and to inspire political liberation movements. It has been used to justify annihilation of Indigenous people by Christian colonists yet given hope to Jews that next year in Jerusalem might be better. How can the same “book” be used for such different purposes? This course focuses on the cultural and political consequences of biblical interpretation. An underlying premise is that the Bible is not static but is rather a nomadic text as it is continuously interpreted in ways that sometimes contribute to human flourishing, but also can result in violence, human diminishment, or death.:Completion of 4.0 credits::::Humanities:
RLG326H1:Roots of Christianity and Judaism::24L:Judaism and Christianity are both considered “religions of the book” but how are they related to each other? This course considers the origins of that relationship by reading a range of Jewish texts from the 6th century BCE to the 1st century CE, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, in order to illuminate the diverse cultural matrix from which early Christianity and Judaism took shape. A major theme of the course is the formation of scriptures and scriptural interpretation as a factor in shaping distinctive Jewish cultures. Attention is also given to “lived religion” and practices that form individuals and communities.:Completion of 4.0 credits:::RLG326H5:Humanities:
RLG327H1:Hospitality and Ethics in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam::24S:Refugee crises in modern times have raised questions concerning what degree of hospitality is owed the stranger or foreigner whose motivation is a new, safe, and secure home rather than being treated as a guest passing through on a time-limited visa. Jacques Derrida’s ideas of both conditional hospitality (e.g., tourists) and unconditional hospitality (e.g., strangers) need to be explored from the perspective of philosophical and ethical traditions including Jewish, Christian, and Muslim ethics.:Completion of 4.0 credits::0.5 credit in  RLG202H1/  RLG203H1/  RLG204H1::Humanities:
RLG328H1:Religion, Race, and the Legacy of Cain and Abel::24L:Cain's killing of his brother Abel is one of the best known but least understood stories in the Bible. For thousands of years, interpreters have puzzled over the gaps and ambiguities of the story in order to piece together the how, what, where and why of this violent incident. This course explores the legacies of Cain and Abel across various religious traditions and in art, literature, and popular culture. It considers the surprising roles that this biblical story has played in modern ideas about religion, politics, and race. All readings will be in English. No knowledge of Hebrew is required.:Completion of 4.0 credits::::Humanities:
RLG329H1:New Atheism and the Study of Religion::24L:A course to look at the rise of a “new atheism” in the late 20th- and early 21st-century.

Contemporary theories on the function and origin of apocalyptic literature inform our readings.:Completion of 4.0 credits::::Humanities:
RLG331H1:Creation Narratives and Epistemologies::24S:The course will examine the importance of Indigenous cultural knowledge and values as presented in various Indigenous Creation Narratives. Creation Narratives or Cosmological narratives have long been studied as mere mythology. Yet, it is in these very narratives that complex, layered, and nuanced epistemologies emerge. Often, these narratives not only lay the epistemological frameworks of cultural value systems, but they also contain what many refer to as original instructions and purpose for the “Original People”.:4.0 credits:::::
RLG332H1:Reasonable and Radical Hope::24L:Human beings have a natural and necessary interest in the prospects of their happiness, their moral improvement, and a progressively more just world. When, to what extent, and on what basis our hope for these things could be reasonable have been central questions in philosophy of religion since the Enlightenment. But genocides and cultural devastation (e.g., the Holocaust or the fates of some Indigenous communities) have compelled more recent philosophers to ask not only about rational hope, but also radical hope. This course explores reasonable and radical hope, first by unpacking the well-established philosophical question of our what we may reasonably expect from ourselves and our world, and then turning to the issue of humans’ capacity to persist when their community and its culture face extinction, i.e., when they may no longer expect anything.:::::Humanities:
RLG334H1:Religion, Space and Diaspora::24L:This course explores the transformation of religion, space and practices in diasporic settings.

This course examines the relationship between: a fundamental shift in the nature of daily experience; an order-of-magnitude expansion of the power of the State; a dramatic reorganization of religious experience and cultures; and a tremendous growth in the enterprise of Western science and technological production. We trace this reorientation over the last two centuries and examine its consequences using philosophical, literary, theological, and scientific sources, as well as recent scholarly work on the topic.:Completion of 4.0 credits::RLG231H1/  RLG387H1::Humanities:

RLG419H1:Ghosts to Ancestors: Racialized Hauntings and Reparative Promise in Psychoanalysis::24L:All forms of injustice disfigure both societies and psyches. Racist, sexist, and other unconscious fantasies of evil and persecuting ‘others’ generate social injustice. At the same time, social injustice distorts the mind. This “dual track” process can drive human beings and their societies mad. Justice depends upon transformations of social structures and moral codes as well as changes within human minds. In order for psychoanalysis to realize its own potential for facilitating justice, it must confront its own historical contribution to injustice. Through a close reading of selected texts from Sigmund Freud and the activist psychiatrist Franz Fanon, this course explores the inherent tensions between colonizing and emancipatory themes within psychoanalytic discourses. Both Freud and Fanon contribute to a psychoanalytic critical theory that have influenced several contemporary ethnographic writers who explore the intricate ways in which social and cultural realities are internalized as unconscious hauntings and tormenting spirits across generations.:::RLG211H1/ RLG301H1/ RLG302H1::Humanities:

RLG421H1:Fragments of Redemption: Sigmund Freud and Theodor Adorno::24S:This course will challenge the prevailing view that the thought of Sigmund Freud and Theodor Adorno is so deeply pessimistic as to be devoid of hope. Freud’s psychoanalytic theories are widely (mis)interpreted in the register of a crude pansexualism and biological determinism. Adorno’s critique of society and the individual is often (mis)interpreted as so ruthlessly pervasive that it forecloses on any possibility for emancipatory transformation. This is a distorted view of both thinkers, that misses the hopeful, utopian currents that motivate and shape psychoanalysis and critical theory. The course will explore the emancipatory currents in Freud and Adorno, and their implications for potentialities of individual, social and ecological transformation.:Permission of instructor::::Humanities:
RLG422H1:Kant's Theory of Religion::24L/12S:An advanced study of Immanuel Kant’s theory of religion, as developed in major writings such as Critique of Practical Reason and Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason.

RLG426H1:Religion in the Public Sphere: Community-Engaged Learning::24S:In a 55-hour placement with a community partner, students are given an opportunity to learn about and reflect upon the ways that religion and religious diversity shape public life.

As we read The Iliad closely, we will study songs from the Russian, Bosnian Muslim, Croatian and Serbian traditions. Employing new performance formulaic theory, we will learn that they share much, in melody and message, with the work of today's hip-hop artists, whose roots of rap "flowing" reach back to the beginnings of Western literature and the epic singers of ancient Greece.

It will also excite your interest in a unique sociological way of understanding your world. We will analyze the globalization of culture, emerging patterns of class, race, and gender inequality in Canada and internationally, criminal and deviant behaviour, and so on. You will learn to understand these and other pressing social issues by analyzing the way the social world is organized. These topics are further taken up in the sequel to this course, SOC150: Introduction to Sociology II: Sociological Inquiries.::::SOC101Y1,  SOC102H1,  SOC103H1,  SOCA01H3,  SOCA02H3;  SOC100H5:Social Science:
SOC150H1:Introduction to Sociology II: Sociological Inquiries::24L/12T:In the sequel to  SOC100H1: Introduction to Sociology I: Sociological Perspectives, this course will explore in more depth the topic of social inequality and the contemporary debates that animate sociology. We may like to think of ourselves as perfectly free but powerful social forces open up some opportunities and close off others, constraining our freedom and helping to make us what we are. By examining the operation of these social forces, sociology can help us know ourselves. The course is also about skills-building, skills useful not only for success at U of T, but beyond the walls of the university.:SOC100H1:::SOC101Y, (SOC102H + SOC103H),  SOC200H1,  SOC200Y1,  SOCB05H3,  SOC221H5,  SOC200Y5:Social Science:
SOC196H1:Stress and Health in Young Adulthood::24L:This seminar is designed to provide first-year students with an in-depth understanding of the critical period of young adulthood and its implications for health and well-being. Throughout the course, students will read and discuss scholarly articles related to the various changes and transitions that young adults experience, including education, work, and relationships. The seminar will also explore the impact of stressors such as food insecurity and social isolation on health and well-being outcomes during this period. Students will engage in critical thinking and writing exercises, culminating in a final paper that they will present in class.

SOC197H1:The Courses of Lives, Histories, & Futures::24L:This course will explore how changes in technology, economy, ecology, culture, and other factors shape how individual lives and social relations tend to unfold. Much of the research and theory that social scientists have produced on the “life course” has focused on how historical events and trends, such as war, economic depression, and trends in family-life have re-shaped life transitions and aging. Those latter changes in turn lead to broad social changes that influence subsequent generations in new ways. In this course we will not be solely concerned with changes in and from the past. We will also keep an eye on the future, and ask how technological changes related to bodies, such as genetic engineering and bioelectric implants, might alter the trajectory of lives and social relations of future generations.

SOC198H1:Explaining the Persistence of Racialized Inequalities::24L:Why are Black and other racialized groups comparatively more disadvantaged than people racialized as White? Although race is a social category, it has profound effects on our life chances and opportunities. Explanations for and strategies to address racialized inequalities have long been debated. Emphasizing sociological perspectives, this course highlights and presents explanations for ongoing racialized inequalities across various social institutions, in opportunities for advancement, and in everyday social interactions. More specifically, this course will discuss racialized inequalities in the following areas: poverty and wealth, the labor market, the educational system, the criminal justice system, health, neighborhoods and housing, the political process and representation, and social interactions and relationships.

SOC199H1:Living Together Differently in the 21st Century: Israel as a case study::24S:How can people with different worldviews and dissimilar moral visions live together? Liberal philosophers have grappled with this question offering solutions including tolerance, peace, and multiculturalism. However, many people today, particularly in the West, oppose liberalism as a cultural message and a political goal. Powerful evidence can be found in the rise of "populist" backlash movements and the sharp polarization between liberals and conservatives. Can Western democracies overcome this crisis? This seminar explores this question from a sociological perspective with Israel as a case study. We will probe the efforts of Israeli activists and professionals to instill non-liberal peace among Jews and Arabs, to bridge the chasm between liberals and conservatives, and to include LGBTs and people with disabilities as equal members of society while surpassing liberal principles. By analyzing their work, we will broaden our understanding about living together differently in the 21st century. Restricted to first-year students.

We critically examine how scholars have gone about studying crime and deviance (the methods they use and the statistics they employ) as well as the major sociological explanations for crime and deviance. We also consider the empirical evidence as it relates to the validity of these explanations and some of the policy fallout from different theoretical approaches.:SOC100H1::SOC150H1:SOC211H5:Social Science:
SOC213H1:Sociological Social Psychology::24L:This course provides an introduction to the systematic study of the influence of individuals, groups, and society on individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviours from a sociological perspective. The course emphasizes interaction among individuals, between an individual and a group, or among groups, all situated within particular social contexts.

SOC215H1:Sociology of Organizations::24L:Organizations are ubiquitous in modern society. Many of us spend the first days of our life in hospitals and our last days in nursing homes. During our lifecourse, we go to school, we work, we dream of becoming a part of some organizations (perhaps an elite university or firm), while we try to avoid becoming a part of other organizations (e.g., jail). Despite their ubiquity and importance in our lives, we seem not to notice organizations or think about how they may be shaping our lives for better or worse. This course will help students begin to see organizations sociologically. We will examine organizations from several theoretical perspectives and learn about empirical developments in organizational sociology.:SOC100H1:::SOC496H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Fall 2016,  SOC489H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Fall 2017,  SOC489H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Fall 2019,  SOC298H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Winter 2023.:Social Science:

SOC230H1:Sociology of Education::24L:In advanced economies, schooling is a near-universal and highly structured institution. During the most impressionable times in their lives, children and adolescents go nearly every day to sit in the same pattern of classes with the same peers. In theory, students both within and across schools are supposed to learn the same things, at approximately the same time, and engage in similar rituals. And yet, this level of standardization often leads to substantively different outcomes across groups. This course investigates the structure of schools and the achievement hierarchies within and across them.:SOC100H1::::Social Science:
SOC240H1:Sociology of Law::24L:This course asks students to think critically about the role of law in society, and to develop a sociological understanding of law and legal institutions.

From transportation to housing, crime prevention to climate change, urban policies cover a number of areas of great concern. While cities are heralded as sites of innovation and economic activity, they are also sites of deep inequality. Cities across the world have produced different responses to address these issues. However, urban policy is not only shaped by policymakers; rather, many different institutions shape public policymaking. Given the range of issues facing urban areas, it is important to understand the policies are designed and implemented, and the multiple actors engaged.:SOC201H1,  SOC202H1,  SOC204H1, and 1.0 credit from  SOC251H1,  SOC252H1,  SOC254H1:::SOC353H1 (offered as "Urban Policy") taken in Winter 2022 or 2023:Social Science:

SOC341H1:Sociology of Scandals::24L/12T:Scandals – corporate, political, or bureaucratic – pervade media reporting and public debate. This course takes up scandals as sociological events: what are the causes of scandals? How are scandals ‘made’? How are scandals represented? And what are the consequences of scandals: do they discredit some actors, and lead to cultural, institutional, and organizational change? Do they lead to reform, used for new professional mobilization, new forms of regulation and oversight, targeted for legal intervention, or do they generate new political shifts, or new memories or narratives? Or are they ignored? The course will also pay attention to how scandals are made public: leaks, investigations, whistleblowers, and media reporting, and the framing of events as scandals worthy of public condemnation. Finally, with scandals often thought of as singular, this course allows students to consider what is in common between these events.

SOC372H1:Transnational Asia::24L:This course approaches Asia from a transnational perspective to enhance our understanding of the complexities involved in Asia’s contemporary transformations. By departing from traditional nation-state-oriented analyses, this class explores how Asia shapes and is shaped by trans-Pacific politics, war and colonial legacies, global capitalism, labor migration, international norms of citizenship, urban development, and flows of ideas and popular culture. By closely examining Asia’s transnational interconnectedness, we question the prevalent notion of Asia and regional studies and highlight the contradictions and challenges Asia faces in its political, economic, social, and cultural spheres. This critical approach is expected to offer a deeper investigation of Asia in and of itself while critiquing dominant assumptions and frameworks found in existing approaches to Asia.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC336H1,  SOC351H1 (New Topics in Sociology: Transnational Asia), offered in Winter 2019,  SOC395H1 (New Topics in Sociology: Transnational Asia), offered in Fall 2019:Social Science:

Taking Muslim Americans as a case study, this course will examine a range of topics, from everyday boundary-making to ongoing global politics pertaining to different Muslim groups in the United States, often drawing comparison with Muslims in other Western countries. More broadly, the course aims to unpack how various global and local/national forces shape the contours, dimensions, and meanings attached to an identity category. To that end, the course begins with some prominent sociological theories, such as intersectionality, double-consciousness, and Orientalism. We will apply these theoretical lenses to analyze issues of race, globalization, cultural citizenship, media representation, and political integration in Muslim American and immigrant experiences.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC349H1,  SOC394H1 (New Topics in Sociology: Deconstructing "Muslim American" - Race, Nationalism and Religion), offered in Winter 2019,  SOC352H1 (New Topics in Sociology: Deconstructing "Muslim American" - Race, Nationalism and Religion), offered in Winter 2020:Social Science:
SOC375H1:Sociology of the City::24L:Cities have played a vital role in the global economy, but within the past decade, their importance has increased. From issues of housing affordability to homelessness, from debt crises to energy usage, from insufficient water to the outbreak of diseases, name a problem that concerns any aspect of social life, and the city is the crucible of where you will find it. On the other hand, cities represent our best hope for finding solutions to these enormous problems since they also serve as incubators of innovation, ideas and wealth creation. It is for these reasons that understanding cities become an important frame for understanding the joys and perils of social life. For over a century, sociologists have focused on understanding different issues related to cities and their urbanization processes. However, in investigating the city, there have been several debates about their futures.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC395H1 (offered as "Sociology of the City") taken in Winter 2022 or 2023:Social Science:

SOC389H1:Sociology of Scandals::24L:Scandals – corporate, political, or bureaucratic – pervade media reporting and public debate. This course takes up scandals as sociological events: what are the causes of scandals? How are scandals ‘made’? How are scandals represented? And what are the consequences of scandals: do they discredit some actors, and lead to cultural, institutional, and organizational change? Do they lead to reform, used for new professional mobilization, new forms of regulation and oversight, targeted for legal intervention, or do they generate new political shifts, or new memories or narratives? Or are they ignored? The course will also pay attention to how scandals are made public: leaks, investigations, whistleblowers, and media reporting, and the framing of events as scandals worthy of public condemnation. Finally, with scandals often thought of as singular, this course allows students to consider what is in common between these events.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC341H1:Social Science:

TRN192H1:Public Health in Canada: Health for the 21st Century::24L:This course deals with preventive care and population health. It will also move into new areas like healthcare and the environment (climate change) and the greening of healthcare. It will look at health as an extension of democracy – of how health extends individual rights beyond the political realm to the social realm, of how it can build social capital and knit populations together. It will look at areas inimical to health, ‘detriments to health’ and how economic inequality can lead to health inequality. Along with this it will look at ways of empowering the individual, the public as agent and a role of public engagement by major institutions. It will also push beyond the popular determinants of health to engage students in a paradigm on next steps, the future challenges in population health. Restricted to first-year students.

We will look at indirect contributors like childcare and basic income. We will examine the public-private debate. We will also take some novel approaches. One is that the university has an expanded role in the 21st century, one that involves public outreach, a role that includes healthcare. Recent academic literature on healthcare notes that it is nation-building. We will look at why. We will examine some cutting-edge ideas, like integrated care, the learning health system, the concept of customer-owners. We will explore whether our healthcare system needs to be anchored by ‘institutions of excellence’ and identify these. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
TRN194H1:Literature and Wicked Problems::24L:This course explores contemporary literature in relation to the interdisciplinary framework of “wicked problems.” Research emphasizes that complex, entrenched problems, like government relations with Indigenous peoples or human impacts on the climate, involve interconnected systems and require approaches that cross disciplines and types of knowledge. The course examines the role of literary works (mostly 21st-century fiction) in addressing these issues of pressing concern to students as global citizens.

TRN197H1:In the Shadow of the Vikings: Depictions of the Early Norse in Medieval, Modern, and Post-Modern Culture::24L:Although rarely attested during the historical era when they were active, since the early nineteenth century the word “Viking” has been popularly applied to describe groups of Scandinavian adventurers who marauded along the frontiers of Medieval Europe: in this respect, the image of “the Viking” may be regarded as much a modern, as it is a medieval, creation. The legacy of historical “Viking activities” was a factor in the development of modern nation states in Scandinavia and the Baltic region, and their contributions to the heritage of people residing in Britain, continental Europe, the Middle East, and even the Atlantic coast of Canada have been and continue to be cited to the present day. Aspects of culture attributed to “the Vikings”—their assumed independence, courage, resourcefulness, and tenacity in the face of adversity, as well as the occult characteristics of their cosmology—have, for better and worse, inspired modern artists, writers, composers, intellectuals, explorers and even political leaders, and persist in present day literature, art, music, sport and popular culture as well. Why and how do elements of historic Viking culture continue to evoke traditions and characteristics popularly attributed to “the Vikings”? What are some implications of “Viking-ness” for those people in the post-Viking Age past and/or present who we may regard—or may regard themselves—as the “cultural descendants” of the Vikings? In this seminar, participants will study selected cultural artifacts of the “post-Viking Age,” along with recent multidisciplinary research, to observe how various “post-Viking Age” cultures and subcultures have selectively appropriated elements of the “Viking” past. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
TRN198H1:The Viking Phenomenon: Commerce, Conflict, and Communication along Europe’s Frontiers, 7th – 15th Century::24L:Perspectives on the impact that the Scandinavian raiders and traders popularly referred to as “Vikings” had on European and World history continue to develop as the work of historians, archaeologists, linguists, and scientists expands our understanding of the past. Recent research has revised the traditional view of the “Vikings” as primarily marauding warriors; in its place, a more complex and nuanced conception of the implications that “Viking activity” had on the social, economic, and political development of the peoples with whom they came in contact has emerged. This seminar will consider the relationship between the traditional conception of the “Viking warrior” and recent research that suggests the broader impact that the “Viking Phenomenon” had upon the economic revival and sociopolitical development of medieval Europe and its frontiers. In the course of the seminar, we will examine a selection of historical records and information concerning artifacts of the material culture of “The Viking Age” in order to better understand the activities of early medieval “Vikings,” not only as warriors, but also as agents of commerce, explorers, pioneers, and rulers.

TRN199H1:Classical Social and Political Thought from the 18th Century Enlightenment to the 20th Century::24L:We begin with European social and political thought during the 18th century, including ideas of enlightenment and revolution. We move on to the 19th century to engage with the critical Marxist theorisation of the new “capitalist” social and political formation, and look at the reception of the Marxist view in the 20th century, all of which continues to affect the character of Western social and political thought.
