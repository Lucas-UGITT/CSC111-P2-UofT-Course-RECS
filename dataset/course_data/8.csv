As we read The Iliad closely, we will study songs from the Russian, Bosnian Muslim, Croatian and Serbian traditions. Employing new performance formulaic theory, we will learn that they share much, in melody and message, with the work of today's hip-hop artists, whose roots of rap "flowing" reach back to the beginnings of Western literature and the epic singers of ancient Greece.

SOC100H1:Introduction to Sociology I: Sociological Perspectives::24L/12T:This course will challenge your views on a wide range of issues that affect us all. It will also excite your interest in a unique sociological way of understanding your world. We will analyze the globalization of culture, emerging patterns of class, race, and gender inequality in Canada and internationally, criminal and deviant behaviour, and so on. You will learn to understand these and other pressing social issues by analyzing the way the social world is organized. These topics are further taken up in the sequel to this course, SOC150: Introduction to Sociology II: Sociological Inquiries.::::SOC101Y1,  SOC102H1,  SOC103H1,  SOCA01H3,  SOCA02H3;  SOC100H5:Social Science:
SOC150H1:Introduction to Sociology II: Sociological Inquiries::24L/12T:In the sequel to  SOC100H1: Introduction to Sociology I: Sociological Perspectives, this course will explore in more depth the topic of social inequality and the contemporary debates that animate sociology. We may like to think of ourselves as perfectly free but powerful social forces open up some opportunities and close off others, constraining our freedom and helping to make us what we are. By examining the operation of these social forces, sociology can help us know ourselves. The course is also about skills-building, skills useful not only for success at U of T, but beyond the walls of the university.:SOC100H1:::SOC101Y, (SOC102H + SOC103H),  SOC200H1,  SOC200Y1,  SOCB05H3,  SOC221H5,  SOC200Y5:Social Science:
SOC196H1:Stress and Health in Young Adulthood::24L:This seminar is designed to provide first-year students with an in-depth understanding of the critical period of young adulthood and its implications for health and well-being. Throughout the course, students will read and discuss scholarly articles related to the various changes and transitions that young adults experience, including education, work, and relationships. The seminar will also explore the impact of stressors such as food insecurity and social isolation on health and well-being outcomes during this period. Students will engage in critical thinking and writing exercises, culminating in a final paper that they will present in class. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
SOC197H1:The Courses of Lives, Histories, & Futures::24L:This course will explore how changes in technology, economy, ecology, culture, and other factors shape how individual lives and social relations tend to unfold. Much of the research and theory that social scientists have produced on the “life course” has focused on how historical events and trends, such as war, economic depression, and trends in family-life have re-shaped life transitions and aging. Those latter changes in turn lead to broad social changes that influence subsequent generations in new ways. In this course we will not be solely concerned with changes in and from the past. We will also keep an eye on the future, and ask how technological changes related to bodies, such as genetic engineering and bioelectric implants, might alter the trajectory of lives and social relations of future generations. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
SOC198H1:Explaining the Persistence of Racialized Inequalities::24L:Why are Black and other racialized groups comparatively more disadvantaged than people racialized as White? Although race is a social category, it has profound effects on our life chances and opportunities. Explanations for and strategies to address racialized inequalities have long been debated. Emphasizing sociological perspectives, this course highlights and presents explanations for ongoing racialized inequalities across various social institutions, in opportunities for advancement, and in everyday social interactions. More specifically, this course will discuss racialized inequalities in the following areas: poverty and wealth, the labor market, the educational system, the criminal justice system, health, neighborhoods and housing, the political process and representation, and social interactions and relationships. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
SOC199H1:Living Together Differently in the 21st Century: Israel as a case study::24S:How can people with different worldviews and dissimilar moral visions live together? Liberal philosophers have grappled with this question offering solutions including tolerance, peace, and multiculturalism. However, many people today, particularly in the West, oppose liberalism as a cultural message and a political goal. Powerful evidence can be found in the rise of "populist" backlash movements and the sharp polarization between liberals and conservatives. Can Western democracies overcome this crisis? This seminar explores this question from a sociological perspective with Israel as a case study. We will probe the efforts of Israeli activists and professionals to instill non-liberal peace among Jews and Arabs, to bridge the chasm between liberals and conservatives, and to include LGBTs and people with disabilities as equal members of society while surpassing liberal principles. By analyzing their work, we will broaden our understanding about living together differently in the 21st century. Restricted to first-year students.

We critically examine how scholars have gone about studying crime and deviance (the methods they use and the statistics they employ) as well as the major sociological explanations for crime and deviance. We also consider the empirical evidence as it relates to the validity of these explanations and some of the policy fallout from different theoretical approaches.:SOC100H1::SOC150H1:SOC211H5:Social Science:
SOC213H1:Sociological Social Psychology::24L:This course provides an introduction to the systematic study of the influence of individuals, groups, and society on individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviours from a sociological perspective. The course emphasizes interaction among individuals, between an individual and a group, or among groups, all situated within particular social contexts.

SOC215H1:Sociology of Organizations::24L:Organizations are ubiquitous in modern society. Many of us spend the first days of our life in hospitals and our last days in nursing homes. During our lifecourse, we go to school, we work, we dream of becoming a part of some organizations (perhaps an elite university or firm), while we try to avoid becoming a part of other organizations (e.g., jail). Despite their ubiquity and importance in our lives, we seem not to notice organizations or think about how they may be shaping our lives for better or worse. This course will help students begin to see organizations sociologically. We will examine organizations from several theoretical perspectives and learn about empirical developments in organizational sociology.:SOC100H1:::SOC496H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Fall 2016,  SOC489H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Fall 2017,  SOC489H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Fall 2019,  SOC298H1 (offered as "Sociology of Organizations") taken in Winter 2023.:Social Science:

SOC225H1:Canadian Society::24L:This course uses a sociological approach to understand current Canadian society, Canada’s role in global politics, and how Canadian social policies compare to the policies of other countries around the world. The topics considered in the course include economics, politics, happiness, health and mental health care, crime and punishment, tolerance for diversity, education, and more. The most current Canadian research and global comparative research are explored to ensure students leave with a thorough scientific awareness of where Canada is, where it is going, and what they think the best policies for Canada are moving forward.:SOC100H1:::SOC297H1 (offered as "Canadian Society") taken in Fall 2022:Social Science:
SOC230H1:Sociology of Education::24L:In advanced economies, schooling is a near-universal and highly structured institution. During the most impressionable times in their lives, children and adolescents go nearly every day to sit in the same pattern of classes with the same peers. In theory, students both within and across schools are supposed to learn the same things, at approximately the same time, and engage in similar rituals. And yet, this level of standardization often leads to substantively different outcomes across groups. This course investigates the structure of schools and the achievement hierarchies within and across them.:SOC100H1::::Social Science:
SOC240H1:Sociology of Law::24L:This course asks students to think critically about the role of law in society, and to develop a sociological understanding of law and legal institutions.

But what is a profession, and what do these disparate groups have in common? This course lays the groundwork for understanding how the “professional projects” define professions, limit entry, create internal inequalities and try to maintain their prestige. The role of policy is key to our understanding of the professions, and we will focus on the role of policies in the creation of professions, in the substance of professional work such as ethics, autonomy and commercialism, and on the role of policies in addressing social concerns of inequality and diversity in the professions.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC322H1:Social Science:

SOC310H1:Sociology of Atrocities::24L:This course focuses on the sociology of atrocities. We focus on the range of social actors and processes involved when atrocities occur, how we identify, name, and respond to atrocities (such as genocide or crimes against humanity), the behavior of bystanders and intervenors, cultural trauma and the effects of atrocities, and processes of commemoration. We investigate the collective and social dynamics to try and explain the role of individuals, groups, and institutional actors in committing atrocities, including the role of group identities, bureaucracies, collective decision-making, shared repertoires, legacies of hate, and peer networks. We study the role of other actors – in particular legal institutions, but also humanitarian bodies, journalists, and others – in identifying, naming and sometimes responding to these atrocities, along with sociological evidence about how they do so and the efficacy of any such response.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC330H1,  SOC397H1 (Selected Topics in Sociological Research: International Criminal Justice & Atrocities), offered in Fall 2013, Winter 2015 and Winter 2016:Social Science:

SOC317H1:Urban Policy::24L/12T:Urban policies reflect how cities and urban areas are designed, built, and managed. They actively shape the ways in which people live. From transportation to housing, crime prevention to climate change, urban policies cover a number of areas of great concern. While cities are heralded as sites of innovation and economic activity, they are also sites of deep inequality. Cities across the world have produced different responses to address these issues. However, urban policy is not only shaped by policymakers; rather, many different institutions shape public policymaking. Given the range of issues facing urban areas, it is important to understand the policies are designed and implemented, and the multiple actors engaged.:SOC201H1,  SOC202H1,  SOC204H1, and 1.0 credit from  SOC251H1,  SOC252H1,  SOC254H1:::SOC353H1 (offered as "Urban Policy") taken in Winter 2022 or 2023:Social Science:

SOC341H1:Sociology of Scandals::24L/12T:Scandals – corporate, political, or bureaucratic – pervade media reporting and public debate. This course takes up scandals as sociological events: what are the causes of scandals? How are scandals ‘made’? How are scandals represented? And what are the consequences of scandals: do they discredit some actors, and lead to cultural, institutional, and organizational change? Do they lead to reform, used for new professional mobilization, new forms of regulation and oversight, targeted for legal intervention, or do they generate new political shifts, or new memories or narratives? Or are they ignored? The course will also pay attention to how scandals are made public: leaks, investigations, whistleblowers, and media reporting, and the framing of events as scandals worthy of public condemnation.

SOC373H1:Deconstructing 'Muslim American' - Race, Nationalism, and Religion::24L/12T:Since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Muslim Americans have once again been cast as both threatening “outsiders” as well as examples of what makes the United States a “nation of immigrants.” What do these contestations teach us about how race, nationalism, and globalization shape immigrant identities? Taking Muslim Americans as a case study, this course will examine a range of topics, from everyday boundary-making to ongoing global politics pertaining to different Muslim groups in the United States, often drawing comparison with Muslims in other Western countries. More broadly, the course aims to unpack how various global and local/national forces shape the contours, dimensions, and meanings attached to an identity category. To that end, the course begins with some prominent sociological theories, such as intersectionality, double-consciousness, and Orientalism. We will apply these theoretical lenses to analyze issues of race, globalization, cultural citizenship, media representation, and political integration in Muslim American and immigrant experiences.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC349H1,  SOC394H1 (New Topics in Sociology: Deconstructing "Muslim American" - Race, Nationalism and Religion), offered in Winter 2019,  SOC352H1 (New Topics in Sociology: Deconstructing "Muslim American" - Race, Nationalism and Religion), offered in Winter 2020:Social Science:
SOC375H1:Sociology of the City::24L:Cities have played a vital role in the global economy, but within the past decade, their importance has increased. From issues of housing affordability to homelessness, from debt crises to energy usage, from insufficient water to the outbreak of diseases, name a problem that concerns any aspect of social life, and the city is the crucible of where you will find it. On the other hand, cities represent our best hope for finding solutions to these enormous problems since they also serve as incubators of innovation, ideas and wealth creation. It is for these reasons that understanding cities become an important frame for understanding the joys and perils of social life. For over a century, sociologists have focused on understanding different issues related to cities and their urbanization processes. However, in investigating the city, there have been several debates about their futures.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC395H1 (offered as "Sociology of the City") taken in Winter 2022 or 2023:Social Science:

SOC389H1:Sociology of Scandals::24L:Scandals – corporate, political, or bureaucratic – pervade media reporting and public debate. This course takes up scandals as sociological events: what are the causes of scandals? How are scandals ‘made’? How are scandals represented? And what are the consequences of scandals: do they discredit some actors, and lead to cultural, institutional, and organizational change? Do they lead to reform, used for new professional mobilization, new forms of regulation and oversight, targeted for legal intervention, or do they generate new political shifts, or new memories or narratives? Or are they ignored? The course will also pay attention to how scandals are made public: leaks, investigations, whistleblowers, and media reporting, and the framing of events as scandals worthy of public condemnation. Finally, with scandals often thought of as singular, this course allows students to consider what is in common between these events.:1.0 SOC credit at the 200+ level:::SOC341H1:Social Science:

Inequality has been one of the primary subjects in sociological inquiries and its scope naturally expands to a global dimension as our societies are increasingly shaped by international connections. This seminar focuses on understanding various manifestations of global inequalities intersected by international hierarchy, race, gender, and class. Yet, these divisions and injustices are neither static nor unchallenged as people react to these realities via divergent methods. This class will read major theoretical approaches to social movements and examine contentious mobilizations taking place in different geographies around the world to reshape the global order ridden with disparities.

While the background readings pertain to the general Western cultural heritage, the literary texts through which we will observe particular applications of the theories of love were produced by some of the outstanding 16th and 17th century Spanish authors (for ex. Rodríguez de Montalvo; Jorge de Montemayor; Miguel de Cervantes; Tirso de Molina, María de Zayas, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz). All the readings will be in English. Restricted to first-year students.
